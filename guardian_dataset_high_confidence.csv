"It looks like a drip and reminds me of a hospital. If he needs a drink, a cup is more appropriate I’ve been with my boyfriend, Wes, for about a year and a half. We don’t live together, and last summer he built himself a four-poster bed, which I thought was really cool. But a few months ago he got one of those water bladders with a long tube and hung it from one side of the bed. He said it was practical, and at first I didn’t mind. I thought it was a joke. There were also moments when I thought it was practical too. Sometimes, when he was drinking from it, I thought: “I’ll have a drink from it as well.” But then I asked him if he was going to take it down, and he just brushed it off. One day, we were having an intimate moment and he whipped out the water bladder and started drinking from it. He should have been concentrating on me so I was annoyed, and now it’s banished. Wes loves hiking and biking, and uses a water bladder then. That’s acceptable – but it’s not for the bedroom It was just a huge turnoff. It looks like a drip and it reminds me of a hospital. When you’re with your partner that’s not the connotation you want. Hydration is important, but if Wes needs a drink during sex a water bottle or a cup of water is more appropriate. The water bladder was up for about two and a half months in total. That moment tipped me over the edge, and thankfully Wes listened to me. We have come to an agreement to keep it out of the bedroom, but I know that part of him wants it back. We are going to a festival this weekend and Wes says he is going to bring two water bladders. I won’t be drinking from one unless there’s an emergency. Wes loves hiking and biking, and uses a water bladder then. I think that’s acceptable as it’s what it was originally designed for – but it’s not for the bedroom. Even though we live separately, as I usually go to Wes’s place, I think he should listen to me when I say I’m not comfortable with something. He did take it down after that incident, but I know if I allowed it, the water bladder would go straight back up.","I get that it was maybe insensitive to do it during sex , but I didn’t expect her to be so bothered After building myself a four-poster bed while I was bored, I attached a water bladder I had lying around the house with a little bit of string, looping it over the top of the bed. I thought it was practical and funny. It was really hot recently, so it was a good way to stay hydrated. At first, Leanne drank from it with me when she came round to stay. She didn’t seem opposed to it. But then when I drank from it during an intimate moment she reacted really strongly. Things came to an abrupt halt there and then, and the water bladder was removed immediately. It felt like an overreaction in the face of something I thought was totally innocent. I get that it was bad timing and maybe a bit insensitive to do it during sex. However, I didn’t expect her to be so bothered. We are going to a festival soon and she’s banned me from using it in the tent too It started out as “look at this fun idea”, and I thought: “Wow, I can drink hands-free.” But then Leanne said she didn’t like the imagery of it. I do get that the thought of me lying in bed with a tube stuck out of my mouth during sex isn’t very attractive. But we are going to a festival soon and she’s banned it in the tent too. She’s OK with me using it when we’re out and about, just not when I’m lying down inside the tent. I think it’s much more practical than a cup – there’s no risk of spillage. And surely a water bladder is appropriate in any context where you’re camping? If we are in the crowds for hours and Leanne runs out of water, and I’ve got litres left in the bladder, I think she’ll end up using it. It’s a different context to the bedroom, but it seems like the whole idea of the water bladder is totally corrupted for Leanne now. There’s not really a middle ground for her when it comes to the water bladder. I’ve suggested getting a smaller one, but to no avail. Ultimately, Leanne’s upset is more important than the convenience. If it means she is happier, then it’s worth it, but privately I think a water bladder is entirely functional. If she said I could hang it off the bed again, I 100% would.", guilty,high
"I have firm boundaries around personal hygiene – and bacteria thrive on wet towels Towels should be for personal use only, but my mum thinks they should be shared in our household of four. That might have been OK when I was a baby, but now I’m 21 I think it’s weird. Mum has this thing about washing and the environment. She has been trying to wash clothes less, and uses these washing bags that capture microplastic fibres to prevent them from going out into the water supply. I support this, but not at the expense of my personal hygiene. She wants our family to only use one or two towels a week, which means the four of us sharing them – my younger brother, Lewis, who is five, my parents and me. I think this is totally gross. Mum says “towels dry, it’s fine” but that’s not true. Bacteria thrives on towels and the idea that a towel is clean just because it has dried misses a crucial point: moisture breeds bacteria, especially in damp, warm environments like bathrooms. I don’t want everyone else’s germs on my body. A towel that’s been used even once can carry a lot of bacteria. Lewis is a messy child. Sharing a towel with him will increase my risk of fungal infections, as he towels after his swimming club. The idea of using his towel is disgusting to me. Mum thinks I’m being a diva, but everyone having their own towel isn’t an indulgence – it keeps us all clean Like most young women, I have firm boundaries around hygiene. Growing up, I didn’t think much about my mum making us share towels, but I began to notice it when I got older. At 16 I said I didn’t want to do it any more and started using a fresh towel every time I showered – and got told off for it. I then compromised and started using the same towel for a week, thinking it was just for me. But what I didn’t know was that Mum was using the same towel to dry herself and Lewis. When I found out, I freaked out. Now I’ve started hiding my towel in my room so no one else uses it. Mum thinks I’m being a diva, but everyone having their own towel isn’t an indulgence – it keeps us all clean. Using someone else’s dirty towel, even if they are family, is gross.","I always shared towels with my family growing up – older generations don’t worry about this stuff From a mother’s perspective, insisting everyone use a different towel every single day is wasteful. It means more laundry, more water, more electricity, and more mental load. When you’re juggling work, meals, school runs and everything else, having the kids share a clean, dry towel is a simple way to reduce the chaos. It’s not unhygienic if the towel is used on clean, just-showered bodies and hung up to dry between uses. Ava wanted a new towel after every single shower and I told her that was contributing to the destruction of the planet, and not good for my mental health. She said she would wash her own towels but I have yet to see that happen. She always just adds her laundry to my pile and then hopes I won’t notice. Teaching kids to share and not get precious over tiny things builds resilience and cooperation Ava’s obsession with personal space is relatively new. She has become more demanding since returning home from university a month ago. I think she’s ready to move out. She’s taken to hiding her towel, but I just think we should share them. If one starts to smell or look questionable I’d wash it sooner, but if it’s dry and clean, it’s fine. I do a regular weekly wash of the towels. I always shared towels with my family growing up. Older generations didn’t think about this stuff – we didn’t have time. There was often only one or two towels to go round, and nobody keeled over from it. My husband and I were sharing towels with Lewis and Ava until she was old enough to start protesting. Teaching kids to share and not get precious over tiny things builds resilience and cooperation. It instills the idea that comfort doesn’t always have to come with individual ownership. Ava isn’t a germaphobe with other things, like sharing my headphones or cleaning up after herself, so I find it funny she has become so obsessive about sharing towels. She needs to remember there’s a difference between good hygiene and becoming germ-obsessed over things that pose little risk.",None,None
"Every surface has something sprouting on it. I didn’t sign up to live in a botanical experiment I’ve lived with my flatmate Cleo for four years now. She wasn’t into plants to begin with. Now she’s obsessed. She’s always cloning plants, trying to grow something new. That would be fine if it was contained to her room, but it’s everywhere. Every surface has something sprouting on it. There are leaves in plastic containers in our living room, small stems in old Gü dessert pots in the bathroom, plants in nursery pots on every kitchen surface. Plants are not the issue. I love plants in our flat – they’re gorgeous. It’s more the constant propagation: the jars, the clippings, the mess … I didn’t sign up to live in a botanical experiment. One time I knocked over a jar with a baby stem in our kitchen while cooking, so I refilled it with fresh water. But Cleo got so mad. She said I’d tipped out the “hormone-rich water” and that I’d slowed down the growing process. But I didn’t know any of this. If she’d placed the plant out of the way, it wouldn’t have happened. I feel like a guest in a trendy houseplant shop – one that never shifts enough plants I feel like a guest in a trendy houseplant shop – one that doesn’t shift enough plants. Cleo has started listing some on Facebook Marketplace and giving them to friends, but we’re still surrounded. There must be over 40 plants in our flat, and our flat is small. There’s also the mess of repotting. We don’t have a garden so Cleo does everything indoors, and drops soil everywhere. I’ve stepped on perlite barefoot and it hurt. The shower can also become a makeshift bath for Cleo’s plants, and I don’t love the leaves and soil that are often left behind. The sink was also constantly blocked from her rinsing out compost trays. To be fair to Cleo, that doesn’t happen as often since I bought it up. There are good sides to Cleo’s green fingers. I do love having our own herb garden – Cleo makes sure there is always basil and thyme on the windowsill for us to pick. And I love a hanging pothos or orchid as much as the next person. But I need my counter space back.","It’s not just a hobby, I’ve created an ecosystem of calm in our city home. Plus, I make good money Jade complains about having plant clippings on every surface, but I’d argue she benefits greatly from the oxygen-rich atmosphere I’ve curated. Plants clean the air, reduce anxiety and look lovely. My propagation habit is not just a hobby, it’s an ecosystem of calm in our big-city home. Coming back from work and misting a monstera is so relaxing. Propagating plants is my favourite thing, and I don’t want to stop. It’s grounding. I have asked Jade to water my plants when I’ve been away, and she always says how much she enjoys it, how it helps calm her down. I know she’d miss them if they were gone. A friend said our flat felt like ‘a healing centre’. Jade calls it a jungle Yes, sometimes I repot things in the kitchen, but I always clean up after. I don’t always catch every speck of soil, but we have a good hoover, so I vacuum it whenever I see it. I’ve become even more interested in propagating recently, as I’ve realised that I can make a bit of money if I do it properly. People pay a lot for new plants in pristine condition, and it could be a nice little side hustle. So yes, there is a small invasion of jars and plastic boxes on windowsills, but what else do we use the windowsills for? I think it’s a creative use of space. Our landlord said the flat has never looked more lived-in. Last week, a friend said our flat felt like a “healing centre”. That was a big compliment, but Jade calls our flat a jungle. When she poured out the water from one of the jars, I was annoyed, because I was trying to make that plant sprout roots. I’d told her you’re supposed to keep the same water as it is filled with hormones. Jade wasn’t that apologetic and it took longer than usual for that plant to grow. I could ease up on the clippings, but I’m still refining my technique. Also, as it’s summer, it’s going to get worse before it gets better, because now is peak growing time. I only got into propagating earlier this year, so it’s been a bit of a shock for Jade to see how quickly things have expanded. But it won’t be for ever. She just needs to be a little bit more patient.",guilty,high
"I see the cat rolling around in poo. Georgia can choose to kiss me or the dirty cat, but not both I didn’t grow up with pets, so never felt that comfortable around them. But then my partner Georgia and I got our cat, Ethel, from a neighbour. I initially pushed back as I didn’t want the responsibility. Now, I tell everyone that having a cat is amazing. However, I find my rules slipping. Initially, I didn’t think I’d want Ethel on the bed, but within a week of getting her that rule was out the window. I’m still trying to make sure kissing the cat stays off limits, though. I see Ethel roll around in poo in our garden – she seems quite interested in faeces. I’ll go outside and say, “Don’t do that”, but she’s a cat, so doesn’t listen, obviously. Georgia, on the other hand, is always kissing Ethel – that’s a cat who’s just licked her own bum or rolled around in poo. She thinks I should want to kiss the cat all the time too, and really doesn’t understand my reluctance. She said if I lose this argument then I have to kiss Ethel, which I don’t want to do Worse still, just after she’s kissed the cat, she’ll try to kiss me. I get really grossed out by that. It’s too much. Georgia doesn’t kiss Ethel on the mouth, but they will bump noses. Ethel will sometimes lick Georgia on the hand or face. I don’t find that as gross as the thought of Georgia placing her lips on the cat’s fur, though. She thinks it’s funny that I won’t kiss her straight after shes kissed the cat. I might leave it half an hour – I’ll have forgotten about it by then. We have different cat parenting styles. I don’t feel the need to pick Ethel up all the time, whereas Georgia loves to cradle her like a baby. I think Ethel tolerates rather than enjoys it. Georgia always wanted us to get a cat. When we lived in another houseshare years ago, she used to lure the neighbour’s cat in through the window. In retrospect, I think I was being primed to accept the idea of having pets. Georgia wrote in to the Guardian because she wants people to side with her. She says: “How can you say kissing a cat is gross?” She’s looking for proof that other people kiss their pets all the time too, but I don’t think they do. She has said that if I lose this argument then I have to kiss Ethel, which I don’t want to do. I think you can truly love your cat without kissing it on the head all the time.","I love the cat, so I kiss her. I don’t see the problem. Darryl’s hygiene logic doesn’t make any sense I would like to state for the record that Ethel does not lick my face on a regular basis. I kiss her on the head a lot, though, and I like to cradle her like a child and I’ve never thought twice about kissing her. I’ve had pets all my life. I even had rats as a kid – though I’m not sure that is going to help my case. I probably kiss Ethel about 20 times a day. When I walk past her, I’ll kiss her little head and we rub our noses together. I don’t want her to lick my face, as I know she does lick her bum, but sometimes she just will. She’s a cat, it can’t be helped. I think it’s weird that Darryl doesn’t want to kiss her. That doesn’t connect for me at all. I find it funny and slightly offensive when, after I kiss Ethel on the head, Darryl recoils from me. He’ll pull back and go “Argh!”. However after 10 or 20 minutes, he’ll have forgotten about it and will let me kiss him, so I wonder: how long is acceptable? Do germs disappear after half an hour? It’s arbitrary and Darryl is not consistent with his stance. Kissing Ethel is so normal to me, so it’s hard to compute his behaviour. Darryl’s the more playful parent overall. That’s why it’s harder to believe that he doesn’t want to kiss her Darryl is home more so spends more time with Ethel. And he’s the more playful parent overall, which is why it’s hard to believe he doesn’t want to kiss her. Darryl also doesn’t pick her up, which I find strange. If we take her to the vet, I have to pick her up. I don’t think he’s ever kissed her. At first, I would get defensive about him not kissing me after I kissed Ethel, but now I’ve got used to him recoiling from me. One time we tried to Google whether pets are clean and who was in the right, but we found arguments supporting both sides. I’d never clean my face after kissing the cat, it just doesn’t feel natural. Also, I kiss her so much that my skin would get dry if I had to wash every time I did. Basically, it’s a losing battle for Darryl. As soon as we got Ethel, all the rules went out the window. She climbed on Darryl and loved him right away, and she has always been very inquisitive. I think he will eventually come around to letting me kiss him after I’ve kissed Ethel.",guilty,medium
"We’ve been speaking about it for ages. She’s just getting cold feet, but I know she won’t regret it My best friend Kady and I are planning a backpacking trip around south-east Asia in a few months and I have proposed the idea of us getting matching tattoos. Kady was initially keen, but now she is saying we should make up our minds when we are out there. I’d rather plan it in advance. We’re both 20, and I think we’ll look back on them when we’re older and remember what a fun life we’ve lived. Tattoos are a reminder of a particular time, and I want to cherish our youth. I’ve found a cool tattoo parlour in northern Thailand, where we’ll be staying. I’ve seen videos of people having great experiences there and the tattoo artist is really talented. I think Kady is worried about what other people think, including her parents. She was on board with the idea when I first proposed it a few months ago, but now she’s told them and they’ve got in her head. They told her that a tattoo will ruin her job opportunities later in life, but that’s rubbish. No one will even be able to see it at work. Tattoos aren’t as taboo as they were 20 years ago, and we both think that they look good. Tattoos are a reminder of a particular time, and I want to cherish our youth It’s not like I want to get a random tattoo. I’m quite creative and have already started sketching ideas that represent who Kady and I are. We met at a swim club when we were five, so my design features water and other elements. It isn’t huge, it’s only about 20cm long. I already have four small tattoos on my arms and torso and love the idea of adding more. I’m not trying to force Kady to do something she doesn’t want to do, I’m just trying to encourage her to live her best life and go through with a plan that we’ve had for a while. I think matching tattoos will cement our friendship. I know she won’t regret it as we’ve been speaking about it for ages. She’s just getting cold feet because her parents know. I’m definitely more adventurous than Kady and don’t care what other people think as much as she does. I am really excited for this trip – I want to look back on this period of our lives and feel like we made the most of it.","What if I grow to hate it or want it removed? We don’t need matching tattoos to show we’re best friends I was initially on board with the tattoo plan, but then I told my parents and they freaked out. I think it’s because no one in my family has a tattoo. They think they are “common”, which I know is classist. My dad also said that no one will employ me if I get one – which is a total overreaction in my opinion – and my mum is worried about the hygiene in the tattoo parlours in Thailand. All of that has got in my head a bit. I’m still keen, I just don’t want to commit to it right now. The trip isn’t for a while, so what’s the rush? I really like the design Marnie has done for us, and I think it’s cute that she wants to get matching ones. Cementing our friendship for life is a nice idea, but a part of me also wonders if I’ll regret it in the years to come. Obviously we’ll always be friends, but what if I grow to hate the design or just want it removed? There’s a lot to consider. I’d also rather just wait and see how I feel once I start travelling. I want to go with the vibe of the trip and also see the tattoo parlour in person, get a feel for what the artist is like and how clean it is before I fully commit. It’s my first one, I think it’s a bigger deal for me Marnie is the kind of person who likes everything to be planned well in advance, whereas I’m more go with the flow. I don’t think getting a tattoo should be scheduled too far in advance. We need to get the feel of the place and tweak the designs based on what they will look like on our bodies. We can only do that on the day we turn up, so I don’t see the point in debating it too much now. I’ve always wanted a tattoo and Marnie isn’t pressuring me. It was actually my idea initially, but Marnie has really run with it. I could definitely go ahead with a tattoo in the summer, but because it’s my first one, I think it’s a bigger deal for me. We’re travelling for six weeks around Vietnam and Thailand, so I want to have a good trip with Marnie – that’s my priority. Making special memories with my best friend is really important to me, but I don’t think it’s necessary to get a tattoo to show how close we are.",innocent,high
"It’s gross – I wouldn’t use her toothbrush, so why would I use her ear phones? I’ve been going out with my girlfriend, Lila, for three years. We obviously know each other intimately, but I just can’t get on board with sharing earphones. There’s something so gross about it. I hate cleaning off someone else’s earwax afterwards and Lila’s ears are generally stickier than mine. Lila thinks I’m overreacting. She thinks that because we’re dating it’s weird to be so grossed out by this. But I wouldn’t use her toothbrush, so why would I use her earphones? We both have cheap pairs and leave them around the flat. But Lila treats both sets as if they are hers, even though I deliberately bought blue ones to distinguish them. I only use mine, so when I see her connecting to my set for a run, or walking out the door with them, I make her swap. This isn’t just me being fussy, it’s actually backed by science. Earwax carries bacteria and earphones can trap moisture. I read an article that said shared earphones can increase the risk of ear infections. Maybe I’m a neurotic germophobe, but I’d rather that than get an ear infection. Lila has lost her earphones twice. She used to have some expensive Apple ones, which she left in a bar. Since then, she’s only had cheaper ones, but she’s lost those too. I don’t want her to lose mine. Earwax carries bacteria. Maybe I’m a germaphobe, but I’d rather that than get an ear infection Sometimes she forgets to bring hers on a journey. Once, on a trip to Wales to see my parents, she wanted to listen to my playlist. I reluctantly gave her my earphones, even though I didn’t want to. I ended up disinfecting them afterwards, which offended her. Lila framed it as if I had rejected a sweet romantic gesture, but I just didn’t like the idea of shared ear goo. There are lots of other ways to connect, after all. We cuddle, we cook together, we watch movies and I’m affectionate. I just don’t want to be guilt-tripped for keeping my earphones to myself. If I have to start hiding them, I will, but I’d rather Lila just stick to the earphone rules of our home.","We kiss and do all the normal things couples do – so why are earphones a step too far? Tim is a bit more of a clean freak than me, but I’m not dirty. I always do the lion’s share of the cleaning in our flat and I shower just as often as Tim, which is once a day (sometimes more, if I’ve exercised). But I don’t see sharing earphones as being risky or gross. In the past, when I’ve lost mine, I’ve had no choice but to use his, and then I just got used to it. Tim says sharing is unhygienic, but that feels overblown. We kiss and do all the normal things couples do. But for some reason earphones are a step too far for him. I’m sure there are more bacteria in our mouths. Whenever I use Tim’s earphones he makes this big show of wiping them down with his sleeve, or gets out this special spray. He physically stops me and makes me take his earphones out if he sees me using them. He’s had a few ear infections in his life, from swimming. I’ve never had one, so I don’t know the pain of that. But I’m pretty sure you can’t get an infection from sharing earphones. If you live together everything is fair game- I think sharing headphones on a journey is quite romantic When Tim once disinfected his earphones after we shared them on a train journey, I was mildly offended but also quite amused. I didn’t leave any earwax on them and I don’t agree with the notion that my ears are more sticky than his. I clean them regularly, it’s just something he’s conjured up to justify not sharing. I also think sharing earphones on a journey is quite romantic. I’m not trying to infect him, I’m inviting him to watch a show that I’m enjoying. It’s a form of connection, and I don’t think humans get enough of that any more – we are always rushing, or listening to separate shows and playlists on the go. Why not share earphones on a plane and be connected to the same thing? For me, it’s not a big deal – if you live together everything is fair game. When you’re in a relationship, you share things. I’m not asking to borrow his toothbrush or razor, and even that wouldn’t be the end of the world to me. I just want to live safe in the knowledge that if I have to listen to the music for 10 minutes I won’t be treated as though I’m some kind of sticky-eared monster.",guilty,high
"I like to keep Dad updated, but only for important things – and on my terms. I am 27! My dad and I disagree about whether he should follow me on the Find My Friends phone app, which lets you track people in real time. He used to, but when I went to university I removed him as a follower. I don’t think he needs to know where I am all the time. I’m 27 now, but it’s still a bone of contention. Dad says I don’t call him enough – I think that’s why he’s being so persistent about being re-added. He says: “I would know what you were up to if you let me follow you on Find My Friends.” But I don’t want him tracking me, as he used to take it too far when I was younger. Once, when I was in a coffee shop, he texted me saying: “Hope you enjoy your coffee.” It’s nosy and I felt like I was under surveillance. It was funny for a bit, but then I thought: how often is he looking? That sort of thing happened several times as a teenager. Dad and I don’t live in the same place, so it’s not like he could do anything about it if I wasn’t where I was supposed to be I’ve lived in London since I was 18, having moved there from the Channel Islands, where my parents and younger brother still live. Dad has both my brothers on Find My Friends, and says they don’t mind it. But I don’t want him to see what I’m up to. I understand him following my younger brother on the app as he still lives at home. It’s useful if you want to check someone’s whereabouts, or see if they are on their way home. But Dad and I don’t live in the same place, so it’s not like he could do anything about it if I wasn’t where I was supposed to be. Recently, Dad used Find My Friends to look up places my older brother was visiting on holiday in Nicaragua. He messaged him things like: “I saw you went to that waterfall.” That would drive me mad. I like to catch up with Dad on the phone; I don’t need to be checked up on in real time. I brought it up at work and my colleagues agreed that the whole thing is weird. Mum doesn’t get involved much but agrees Dad should drop it. I like to keep him updated, but only when it’s significant, and on my own terms. There are no big secrets. It’s just that I’m an adult.","Martha isn’t great at keeping in touch, so it’s nice to know she’s alive. It’s not stalking, it’s love In my defence, I have the rest of my family on Find My Friends. I have three children and Martha is the eldest. But my two sons are on my side, and they don’t mind being followed at all. I’m a town planner and I really like maps. I don’t live with all my children, so I like to look up where they are. That way, when I visit them and we go to those places, they feel familiar to me. It’s a virtual way to follow their lives. We’re in separate places and I don’t see them very often, so it’s nice to take an interest in their daily routines. It’s also quite handy when they go on holiday. When my eldest son went to Nicaragua, it was really interesting to see where he was visiting along the coast, as I knew nothing about the country. I saw the little pinpoints, then Googled those places to see his trip for myself. You can change the background to look at it in map form, or look at the terrain. It’s really nice. And when we are all in the same place, the app is really practical when we meet up, as you can see where people are, or why they are late. Martha sends photos when she travels for work saying: ‘Guess where I am?’ I joke that I wouldn’t have to guess if I could follow along Martha makes out that I look at it obsessively, but I don’t. I’d never message her to ask what she’s doing. When I did that before, it was just a joke. But it is quite nice to know she is alive, because she’s not good at keeping in touch. We are physically separated – I live on an island so I can’t just jump on a train to see her. The app makes me feel more connected to her. Martha sends photos when she travels for work saying: “Guess where I am?” I joke that I wouldn’t have to guess if I could follow along. Martha left home a long time ago now. I don’t wait for her texts, or worry about her in London. She’s very free and independent and safety has never been a worry; I just want to be caught up on what she is doing. My other kids are very relaxed about the Find My Friends thing. They understand that it’s not stalking, it’s love.",guilty,high
"We should make a house fund for garden stuff. We already have one for a cleaner, so what’s the difference? Living in a shared house with Raheem and one other flatmate is a bit of a balancing act with splitting bills, dishes, and deciding who gets the good shelf in the fridge. But now we’re in a moral and financial standoff over grass. Our house has a decent-sized front and back lawn which is the landlord’s responsibility. Except now they’ve decided to let nature reclaim it. The grass is out of control, weeds are creeping up – it looks awful. I want to cut the lawn myself but that means buying a lawnmower and maybe a strimmer. Raheem is vehemently against paying for any of it. He says it’s not our house or our responsibility. He only moved in last year, so I get it. But I want to have barbecues in the summer, and walk to my front door without it feeling as if I’m entering Narnia. Raheem said we should delay doing the work ourselves for as long as possible. But by that point the weeds will be even worse I think we should make a house fund for garden stuff. We already have one for a cleaner, so what’s the difference? Raheem is dragging his heels and saying “grass-cutting is the landlord’s job”, which I know, but surely we can take some initiative? I’ve been here five years, and I don’t remember the grass ever being this long. It’s spring now, so it’s going to get worse. The landlord has come over to trim it before, but now he is living abroad and won’t answer our emails. I tried mentioning it via text and he just pointed out that he hadn’t raised the rent since I moved in, as if I’m supposed to be grateful. So now I’m stuck between wanting to prioritise my living space and not wanting to do free work for someone who doesn’t care. My other housemate says she will just go with the majority. Last week, Raheem said we should keep pressuring the landlord and delay doing it ourselves for as long as possible, and that only if we don’t get an answer by June should go ahead and do it ourselves. But by that point the weeds and grass will be even worse. It’s really unfair that I have to put this much effort into a house that I don’t own, but it is my home. I don’t think the landlord is going to do much and we might as well enjoy our summer now, which means not wading through weeds when we go outside.","The house is not our responsibility. We have a contract which says the landlord handles the gardens Even when you’ve found a “good” landlord, issues still crop up. I found this house last year after moving out of an awful, overcrowded place, and things have been smooth until now. I like it here and get on well with Eleanor, but I’m not attached to the place. She’s been here five years and so there’s some sentimentality. But the house is not our responsibility. We have a contract which says the landlord handles the gardens. He’s in the wrong – I’m not about to reward that by shelling out money for a lawnmower just to make their property look nice. I don’t care much about using the garden in summer. I’d rather go to the park. And we’re not just talking about doing a quick tidy-up with a pair of shears. She’s asking me to split the cost of a machine, find somewhere to store it, and take on a chore that’s officially not our job. What if it breaks? What if the landlord gets used to us doing it and never lifts a finger again? I’m all for enjoying our summer. But I’d rather do that without dropping cash on a lawnmower for a lawn that isn’t ours I care about living in a decent place too. But I can live with things looking like Jurassic Park for a bit because I can’t afford to spend £100 on garden equipment and hours of my time doing a job I hate. I’ve never had a garden before. I don’t even know how to weed, and I’m just not interested. I care more about not setting a precedent that says: “If you ignore your responsibilities for long enough, we’ll handle it for you.” I think we should keep emailing the landlord as a house and attach pictures of the growth. Eleanor wants me to put the pressure on because I’m the newest, but surely we’re stronger as a unit? I believe there are proper channels for all this and we don’t need to suddenly become part-time groundskeepers just because the landlord is slacking. I’m all for enjoying our summer too. But I’d rather do that without dropping cash on a lawnmower for a lawn that isn’t ours. I don’t think anyone can force me into paying for that and our third housemate is kind of on my side. But if Eleanor wants to spend money on the garden herself, then she can go ahead and do that.",innocent,medium
"He says his throat is dry but to me spitting is a sign of disrespect. I’ve seen people look shocked by it My boyfriend, Ahmed, has a habit I find disgusting: he’s always spitting in public. I think that’s bad enough, but he does it really loudly, which makes it worse – a huge hack sound followed by a big glob of spit, which goes flying. It’s so gross, and sometimes draws attention. I find myself apologising to anyone who catches our eye after he does it, and they always look shocked, but Ahmed rarely notices. He doesn’t spit to be rude – he says that where he grew up, in Saudi Arabia, spitting is normal and not seen as disgusting. He used to have spitting competitions at his school, and girls and boys competed against each other. Once he estimated that he could spit up to 8ft away. He said it in jest in our early days of dating, but I was horrified. However, when I asked, jokingly, if I could spit beside him he told me it was “more of a men’s thing”. That proves he does have some internalised stigma around spitting. But only if he has to watch a woman doing it. Quite ironic, really. My mum watched Ahmed spit towards her car once when he needed to clear his throat, and I saw her mouth drop open Ahmed says he needs to spit because his throat is always dry, but if that’s the case it’s been dry since the day we met in 2019 and he needs to get it checked out. To me, spitting is a sign of disrespect and seen as uncouth. I don’t mean that in a snobby way, but it suggests you don’t have manners. My mum watched Ahmed spit towards her car once when he needed to clear his throat, and I saw her mouth drop open. I told her it was part of Ahmed’s culture and she said it was fine, but I think she was mortified. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes I guess Ahmed has always shown me exactly who he is and has never tried to hide anything about himself. On our first date he told me he was once in £20,000 of debt. I rate his honesty and don’t want him to change – except for this one annoying habit. Ahmed could stop spitting if he really wanted to. He is easy-going and a good communicator, but he won’t properly discuss giving it up. I have asked him to control it and he’s said he’s trying, but he could improve a bit more.","It’s just a habit that society has arbitrarily decided is gross. Xenia needs to be more tolerant I don’t spit to offend, but because it’s second nature. I always spit to clear my throat or when I’ve got a sour taste in my mouth. It’s just a habit. My throat gets dry, and spitting solves the problem. It’s a practical necessity, not an act of rebellion. I’ll admit the sound might be a little jarring. But in Saudi Arabia, spitting wasn’t a social faux pas like it is in the UK. It was practically a sport. We’d measure distances, compare techniques. People spit as they go into a mosque, or after smoking. So now, years later, I don’t even think about what it means. I have tried to explain it to Xenia, but she doesn’t really get it. She says I need to try to tone it down. Xenia thinks about my spitting a lot. She winces every time I do it, and apologises to strangers on my behalf as if I’ve just committed some unspeakable crime. She acts as though I’ve spat on someone, when really all I’m doing is just clearing mucus from my throat. What’s next? Banning sneezes in public? Issuing fines for throat-clearing? I have tried to tone down how emphatic my spitting is because I know that Xenia hates it. Now, I’ll spit straight on to the ground instead of firing it out quickly and at a height. Xenia says she likes my honesty – well this is part of the package. The guy who explained his financial troubles on our first date is the same guy who occasionally feels the need to expectorate. I get that some people find it unpleasant. But am I really supposed to change something that feels entirely normal to me just because society has arbitrarily decided it’s gross? What’s next? Banning sneezes in public? Issuing fines for throat-clearing? I know Singapore fines people for spitting in the streets, but we don’t live there. Xenia needs to build up some tolerance. I put up with her annoying habits because I love her. The worst thing about me is that I occasionally launch some saliva into the ether, which I will try to tone down. But ultimately I’ve been spitting for too long now to totally stop.",guilty,high
"Surely doing a favour badly is worse than not doing it at all? It took me three hours to fix A few weeks ago, while I was preoccupied with medical exams, my housemate Ray kindly offered to wash my car. I was very thankful for the gesture as the stress from studying meant that some key chores had fallen by the wayside. I usually wash my car once a month and it was hard to see it gathering dirt. However, I later found out that he had used only soap and water. No car cleaning products like tyre cleaners, wax or glass polish – just a basic soap I had lying around. He thought it would work fine, but my car looked streaky and unclean afterwards. I actually think it looked worse than before. The glass wasn’t as clear as I’d like it to be and the paint was all marked. After it rained, it looked even worse. I cleaned it myself later that week, and had to go over the whole car again, using proper shampoo, microfibre cloths and a decent wax to undo the damage Ray had done. I think Ray is great but he needs to take a bit of responsibility for doing a bad job Ray thought I was being dramatic. “It’s just a car,” he said. “It gets dirty again anyway.” But that’s not the point. A car is a reflection of its owner. If it looks messy and unkempt, what does that say about me? I like things to be neat, polished, and well maintained. Ray, on the other hand, seems to think rainwater counts as a second rinse. We had a bit of a debate about it, but I knew better than to start a proper argument with him as we get on very well. But I think he should have offered to reclean it, or at least help me reclean it. If not, I would have appreciated a few quid towards a professional clean. I did make a couple of jokes about it, such as “When are you going to give me the cash for a new car wash?” But Ray just laughed them off. I was kind of being serious though. Ray still insists he did me a favour, but I see it differently as I had to fix his so-called favour with three hours of hard work. Surely doing a favour for someone badly is worse than not doing it at all? I think Ray is great, but he needs to take a bit of responsibility for doing a bad job. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes","Cars are machines. They don’t need pampering. You clean them, they get dirty again ; life goes on I should have known better than to offer to help Liam wash his car when he was stressed. I thought it was a simple gesture, like holding the door open or lending a drill, but now I wish I hadn’t bothered. I haven’t heard the end of it. I turned up with a bucket, sponge, and a bottle of Fairy Liquid: the standard kit. This is how my dad did it, how his dad did it, and presumably how Henry Ford did it too. I got the job done in 45 minutes and Liam was very grateful at first. He’d been so busy studying and hadn’t had time to clean his precious car. However, he recoiled when I told him what I’d used. He went out to inspect it and made a few comments like, “Oh, it’s streaky.” Then after it rained, he inspected the car again and found more streaks. I didn’t care: in my mind I had done him a favour. Liam treats his secondhand Fiesta like a priceless work of art. He ‘preps’ the cleaning with a clay bar – he’s lost his mind But Liam said he had to reclean the car for hours, and that I should have helped him a second time. He even suggested that I pay for a professional wash to remove the streaks. I laughed in his face and refused on both counts. I think he’s got a cheek: I did a nice thing for him, and he tried to make money off me to “correct” that. Soap and water have worked for generations. Why complicate things? Anything else – waxes, polishes, ceramic coatings – is just car vanity. But Liam insists on treating his secondhand Ford Fiesta like a priceless work of art. I caught him using a clay bar last week to “prep” the cleaning process. He’s got special shampoos, two buckets – the man has lost his mind. Frankly, I’m embarrassed to be seen with him at the petrol station. Last week, he was standing there buffing his bonnet while I was filling up. He spends entire Sunday afternoons massaging his car as if he’s trying to bring it to life. A car is a machine. Machines do not need to be pampered. You clean them, they get dirty again; life goes on. I won’t be paying him a penny and I think he should be thanking me for washing his car at all, instead of complaining about my tried-and-tested technique.",innocent,high
"The old fittings are works of art – replacing them with dull modern ones would be blasphemous My boyfriend Raf and I have just bought our first home and we love it. We found a two-bedroom Victorian house with original features, including the fireplace and geometric tiles in the hallway. I’m of the opinion that the original features should all be kept because they are beautiful. It’s so rare to find period homes and we shouldn’t be ripping everything out. Raf disagrees. He’s all about the bottom line and his taste is more modern. We have stained glass windows which are lovely but Raf says they’re bleeding heat and should be replaced. He says our heating bills will come down by 45% if we get double glazing. I’m gutted. I looked at a way to encapsulate the stained glass instead of getting rid of it, but it’s more expensive and we’re on a budget. We’ve also got stunning wooden parquet floors which need a lot of care. But Raf wants to steam clean them, which can damage them. When I saw him steaming them one Saturday, I shouted: “You can’t do that!” I was convinced I could make Raf come around, at least to the fireplace. Now I’m realising how different we are We’ve also argued about replacing the geometric tiles and whether to rip out the fireplace in the front room. I love the colour of the tiles and ripping out the fireplace would be blasphemous, but he wants a sleeker look. The previous owners had modernised the rest of the room but left the fireplace, so Raf says it doesn’t fit aesthetically, as well as taking up too much space (it is rather large and juts out slightly). But my dream is to restore other features in the room, such as the exposed brick, and take it back to its original vibe. Raf and I have different tastes, but as our last place was rented we couldn’t change the decor. We did talk about some of this before we bought the house, but I was convinced I could make Raf come around, at least on the fireplace. Now I’m realising how different we are. I want to pay homage to the house’s history but Raf wants to put our own stamp on it. I think original features are works of art and should be preserved but Raf says I’m getting overly emotional about it. I need to convince Raf that my interior tastes are superior. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes","The fireplace is too big, the windows leak heat and the floor doesn’t go with anything. Let’s fix them It’s not that I don’t like period features in a home, but I just believe that unless something has a practical purpose, it should be scrapped. If stained glass windows serve no function other than being pretty, and double glazing will cut our heating bills in half, then of course we should get double glazing. Encapsulation was a more expensive option but I am open to it if it keeps Rupi happy. The fireplace is a bigger point of contention. I can’t wait to rip it out. It’s an eyesore and it’s very big – I want the space in our living room to actually live in. Rupi says that once we take out these features we can’t go back, and that people would kill for some of the period features in our home. Yes, the house is gorgeous and we bought it because we both liked its character, but I do want to modernise some things. The ugly blue and red Victorian tiles in the hallway just don’t go with the colour scheme we’ve agreed on. We agreed to rip them up when we made an offer on the house, but now she’s going back on her decision. In our last place we had a disagreement or two over cushion colours or lamp choices, but not like this I made a joke that Rupi was being “emotional” about everything because she’s acting as if the house will put some sort of curse on us if we swap the windows or take out the fireplace. She is treating me as if I’m a murderer! In our last place we had a disagreement or two over cushion colours and lamp choices, but nothing like this. I can compromise on the tiles. I can even come around to treating the old floors (although in an ideal world I would like to lay carpet in most rooms) but I definitely want to rip out the fireplace. It is too large and doesn’t go with the room or any of our furniture. I think that’s a good enough reason to scrap it. It’s a house not a museum, and we should decorate it in a way that best serves our needs in 2025. Energy bills are expensive and space is scarce. We can’t keep features that take up space and cost us money just because one of us likes them. It just doesn’t make any sense.",guilty,high
"I’m afraid our friends who have kids will ostracise us because of Peter’s attitude My partner Peter and I have decided to be child-free since we got together nine years ago. We are both 36 and happy with our decision. But recently, a lot of our mates have had kids and Peter is struggling with it. I don’t want a child, but I do like them, whereas Peter just doesn’t. My reasons for not wanting children are to do with money, the climate crisis and not wanting to sacrifice my very nice life. But Peter just finds kids annoying and isn’t comfortable being around them. If there are kids playing on a train, he has to move carriages. His tolerance for child-created noise is very low. Once, a friend had to bring their two-year-old to a child-free barbecue we’d organised. Peter later told me the child had ‘ruined the vibe’ In the past three years, three couples we’ve known for years have had children, but Peter doesn’t want them to bring their kids when we invite them over. I’ve told him that life doesn’t work like that. Once, a friend had to bring their two-year-old to a child-free barbecue we’d organised because they couldn’t afford a babysitter. Peter later told me the child had “ruined the vibe”. He made it awkward and was noticeably annoyed whenever the child needed attention or interrupted the adult conversation. Our friend left early and we haven’t hung out with them since. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes Peter can’t accept that his friends have to bring their kids along in some social settings now. If a friend can’t stick to a plan because something’s come up with their child, he won’t say much, but privately he is annoyed. I don’t think he understands how hard it is for new parents. A couple we know who have a newborn cancelled dinner with us recently because they were too tired, and Peter was huffing about it to me. When our mates talk about pregnancy or childcare he gets very bored and tries to change the subject. I’m worried he will ostracise us from our good friends because he can’t get on board with their new lifestyle. Peter is funny and jolly in other settings but with children there, he can’t relax. I think he needs to try harder.","I just want to have a child-free social life, and my friends who have kids should respect that I don’t despise kids, I’d just rather not be around them. But it’s become harder recently because so many of our mates have had them. I want to spend time with them and not their babies. Alexis says I need to be more understanding but I have tried. I’d never deliberately make anyone feel bad if they had no choice but to bring their kid along to something. But when we were hosting a barbecue and I said, “It’s a child-free night, guys,” I expected friends to respect my wishes. It’s like having a child-free wedding: you have to respect what the host wants. When our friend had to bring their toddler I agreed reluctantly, but it was annoying because everyone else had sorted childcare and we’d given advance notice. Their toddler was a bit bratty so it ruined the evening because everything became about the child. No one could really let loose and then they had to leave early. I thought: well, that’s why we said no kids. Alexis and I have never wanted kids and it’s worked out well for us so far. But she is a bit maternal, whereas I don’t have any paternal instincts. I hate the disruption kids cause to adult socialising time and I don’t have the patience to entertain them Once children become teenagers it’s fine as I can talk to them and get to know them, but I’m awkward around babies and smaller children. I’ve always been that way. Alexis thinks there has to be some deep-rooted reason for my dislike of kids, but there isn’t. I just want to live a child-free existence and minimise my time around noisy babies. My sister has two girls and I love my nieces. They’re teenagers now but my tolerance was just as low for them when they were young. I hate the disruption kids cause to adult socialising and I don’t have the patience to entertain them. I think parents are amazing. They are selfless and have so much energy and love, but it’s not for me. Alexis says I need to work on my tolerance so we don’t lose all our mates, but it’s hard. Perhaps I need to get better at disguising my lack of interest in their kids.",guilty,medium
"I hate talking to anyone for the first two hours of my day. I think that should be respected Living with an early riser when you’re not one yourself can drastically decrease your quality of life. I should know, I live with Kevin. I like the fact he is an organised flatmate. He always makes enough food for two and he’s very tidy. But he gets up so early and makes a lot of noise, which really winds me up. Every Sunday, while I’m still in bed, Kevin stomps around in the kitchen at 8am, making a smoothie before the gym. I’ll drift back to sleep, but then he comes back two hours later and makes breakfast, clattering pans and playing music loudly. I’m glad he’s so happy and I don’t want to control when he gets up, but I’d love it if he could keep the noise down. Kevin says he physically can’t sleep in. That’s fine. But why should I suffer just because he’s an early bird? Sometimes Kevin jokes that I’m lazy, but we just have different body clocks. When I hear Kevin stomping around in his work shoes on our wooden floors, or opening and closing the fridge, it’s jarring I get up around midday on the weekend. I don’t feel bad about it. During the week, our schedules work a bit better: Kevin is up at 6.45am, showers and makes breakfast before I rise at 9am for work. But sometimes, when I hear Kevin stomping around in his work shoes on our wooden floors, or opening and closing the fridge, it’s jarring. Even more so than at the weekends, because sleep before work is precious. On the other hand, Kevin has been my personal alarm clock on occasions. He says I should be grateful for the noise in the week because I’ve been known to be late starting work when I’ve accidentally slept in. But generally, I’m not a morning person and I hate talking to anyone for the first two hours of my day. I think that should be respected. Kevin says I should try getting up earlier as it would make everything easier, but why should I? Late sleepers always get a bad rep, but I’m actually just as productive as Kevin. I would really appreciate it if he stopped pressuring me to become an early riser and simply worked on being quieter. I don’t think I need to change.","Reggie is a night owl. I can hear him after midnight sometimes, but I don’t say anything The early bird catches the worm. It’s a well-worn adage for a reason. Early risers are known to have better sleep, better moods and are even at a lower risk of certain cancers. I like getting up early and starting my day with purpose. I don’t use the snooze button and I don’t feel groggy in the mornings: I hop out of bed. I think Reggie wishes he could be like me, but because he isn’t one of those people who gets up with the lark, he wants to control my schedule and noise output. I don’t deliberately try to wake him up, but if I need to go to work or the gym, that involves walking along the hall in our flat and making breakfast. Sometimes, I’ll come back from the gym at midday and Reggie is still in bed. If he wants me to be quieter, he needs to have a reasonable cut-off time for making noise in the mornings, particularly at the weekend. There have also been times I’ve woken Reggie up and he’s been grateful During the week, for example, we both agreed that noise after 11pm isn’t acceptable. But Reggie is a night owl, and when I’m in bed I sometimes hear him shuffling around, playing music or eating. I don’t often say anything, even if it goes on until midnight. But I don’t think he affords me the same privilege in the mornings. It’s less acceptable to ask me not to make noise at midday on a Saturday. It’s the weekend! By midday, the day is half gone. The world is awake and Reggie should be too. He’s 32, not a child. I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect me to make food silently, or tiptoe around because he’s still asleep. There have also been times I’ve woken Reggie up and he’s been grateful. He slept in after a night out once, and I had to wake him up for work. If both of us were night owls, the flat would be chaos. I can try to be a bit more considerate with noise in the mornings, but it would be easier for us both if Reggie got up at a reasonable time on the weekends – around 10am – so I don’t have to worry about making breakfast after the gym.",innocent,medium
"As a couple, we shouldn’t condone that behaviour – plus we’re friends with the ex Brody and I have been together for eight years and have a big friendship group. Recently a couple in the group broke up and it’s dividing our wider circle. My sympathies are with the girl who got cheated on. I think it’s right that, as a couple, we don’t condone this behaviour and make it known where our loyalties lie. But Brody doesn’t want to pick a side. He says that we have no business getting involved in a breakup and that he wants to stay friends with them both. To me, that is a cop-out. I always say “a friend to all is a friend to none”, and by trying to be impartial he is actually showing where his sympathies lie. Naturally, this has been the pattern for most of the couples in our group: the guys want to look cool and stay friends with the guy who cheated, while the girls are pretty much all on her side. I don’t think we should be going out of our way to stay friends with a man who lies, cheats and hurts women Brody’s 30th birthday is coming up soon and there’s a big debate about who we invite. Brody believes we shouldn’t ostracise anyone. He wants to invite both the guy and the girl. I’ve already told the girl that, as a couple, Brody and I support her. But if Brody gets his way, she’ll see her cheating ex there. It’s not a good look. He says if we invite everyone, we’ve covered our backs. But I think we need to make a point. I’m disappointed because I didn’t think that Brody was that much of a sheep. He’s very progressive and takes my side on a lot of feminist issues. I don’t have to explain things to him the way some of my friends do with their partners. But on this issue, I’m a bit shocked. I don’t think we should be going out of our way to stay friends with a guy who cheats. Brody was actually closer to the girl who got cheated on – they went to university together. So it blows my mind that he is morphing into one of those “bros” who doesn’t challenge toxic male behaviour. It feels like a win for the patriarchy. Maybe I’m getting triggered by the whole thing because I was cheated on in the past. I don’t think Brody would cheat on me, but this situation is making me feel weird. I’m just trying to be a good friend. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes","Other people’s breakups aren’t any of our business. All we can do is try to maintain our friendships Rhea is making a bit of a mountain out of a molehill. Firstly, another couple’s relationship has very little to do with us. We might all be in the same friendship group, but I don’t think every person needs to get involved if one couple breaks up. My take is this: if we act as neutral as possible, then we get to keep all our friends. Surely that’s a win for me and Rhea? I love the couple that broke up. I wasn’t as close to the guy at first, as I knew the girl from our university days, but over the years we’ve partied and travelled together a lot. Obviously when I found out that he had cheated, I was sad for them both. But I don’t know the ins and outs of their relationship, so I reserve judgment. I’ve actually heard he’s with a new girl now, the one he cheated with, so it’s not like he cheated just for a laugh – there was a real reason. I’m not condoning cheating, but it sounds like the relationship was on the rocks for a while before it ended. Breakups are hard in a big group, because people gossip and want you to pick a side, but we don’t have to To keep everyone happy, I’ve invited both of them to my birthday. Rhea called me a wet wipe, but what am I supposed to do? Stop inviting my friend out because he cheated? It really isn’t my business. Breakups are hard in a big group – people gossip and want you to pick a side. But we don’t have to. If I invite them both, they can work it out, and Rhea and I get to stay out of it. Of course we’ll give the girl a heads-up and she can make her own decision. I want to stay in contact with her, but I probably talk to the guy more now. It doesn’t mean I agree with his actions or want to be like him. I’m a bit worried for my future with Rhea if this happens again, because of how heated she’s getting over it. More of our friends will inevitably break up and we can’t be arguing over it; it’s not healthy. I’ve never cheated on a partner and I’d never cheat on Rhea. But now Rhea says I am making her feel weird because I am agreeing with the guy. I don’t think that’s the case. I just believe the situation is more nuanced than “cut him out, he’s a bad guy”. I honestly think this is the best solution for all involved.",guilty,medium
"I’ve been collecting art from all over the world for years, and cheap frames don’t fit or look good I’ve been living with my boyfriend Raf for a year now, and we’ve been putting off framing our art. I am a writer and Raf is a designer. We don’t struggle financially but we have to budget. I’m looking after the smaller pieces of decor in our flat, such as cushions, plants and colour schemes, whereas Raf is very handy with making and upcycling furniture that we find in markets. We’re both quite creative and thrifty. But when it comes to spending money on framing art, Raf has this huge block. I’ve been collecting pieces on my travels for years. Before I met Raf I’d bought paintings in Vietnam, street art in Brazil and other bits online. I’ve suggested taking them to a picture framer and getting them framed professionally, in colours that match our home, but Raf won’t hear of it. He says: “Let’s just get some cheap frames from Ikea and be done with it.” Raf says we have more pressing things to tend to in our home, but what’s more pressing than stuff you look at every day? But those frames won’t fit my art properly and are also limited in style. Custom frames elevate your art and make it look more expensive. Yes, they cost a lot of money, but once it’s done it will last for ever. Raf says we have more pressing things to tend to in our home, but what’s more pressing than the stuff you have to look at every day? Some of my favourite pieces are in old, cheap frames and others have yet to be put up. Raf suggested we put up the pieces that are already framed, but I hate the old frames. He also suggested sticking the other pieces to the wall temporarily with Blu-Tack, which I refuse to do. One time he put a landscape of mine that I bought in Costa Rica in this awful antique gold frame he got from work. It didn’t look good – it didn’t fit the art. I took it out and we had a disagreement over it. Raf works with a lot of carpenters so I suggested he ask them to help him with the framing, but he said he doesn’t want to look “cheap” at work. We’ve opened a joint account since moving in together. I don’t want to betray Raf’s trust by spending a chunk of the money on framing if he thinks it’s a bad idea, but I am really tempted. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes","Good art speaks for itself, regardless of the frame, and the prices we’ve been quoted are madness Meera is making me sound like an uncultured swine here, and that’s not the case.

Meera has about 12 pieces that she wants to hang up in our home. To get the type of frames she likes, we were quoted £700. For picture frames! It’s madness. Meera says it’s worth it but I disagree. If art is good, it can speak for itself. It doesn’t need fancy frames. Something subtle that fits properly is fine. I found a gold frame at work recently and surprised Meera by placing one of her pieces in it, but she hated it. Meera said I’d made the artwork look “tacky” and that only custom frames would do. I was just trying to help. I suggested getting frames off Etsy to save money but she insists on getting them all custom designed. Meera threatens to get it done by withdrawing money from our joint account. I think it’s a betrayal of our trust We have been together three years, and this is our first time living together. We’ve put off a lot of decorating due to lack of cash and are doing the urgent bits first. Meera and I are both creative but you learn a lot about each other when you share a space. I didn’t foresee art and interiors being an issue as we pretty much have the same taste in design. This is more of a finance issue: I think frames are unnecessarily expensive, Meera sees them as a non-negotiable items. She keeps threatening to get them done by withdrawing money from our joint account. I think that’s a bit of a betrayal of trust. Meera has been on at me to take the pictures into work to get the carpenters to make the frames, but 12 is just too big an ask. They would probably do them for free and I just can’t ask them to do that. It’s a new job and I don’t want to look tight. Perhaps we can do the frames once we’ve saved up a bit. I’d like to put the art that is already framed up as it is – the frames work fine. The other bits can be Blu-Tacked for now, and wait until we are richer.",innocent,medium
"Jake is a grown man – he should care about his hygiene. Showering is hardly a massive chore Jake, my 31-year-old little brother, is temporarily living with me in my flat. I love him but I’ve noticed he has a few strange habits. The main thing is his hygiene – or lack of it. I don’t say this to be mean, but Jake showers so infrequently that it shocks me. I first noticed it a month after he moved in. I realised that the shower seemed barely used so I asked him: “Do you shower every day?” He said no, he showered usually every three to four days. That’s only twice a week. Growing up, Mum always impressed upon us the importance of being clean and well presented, and we were encouraged to bathe daily. My brother was living on his own before he moved in with me, and has been single for a while. Maybe that’s why he’s dropped the habit. When I asked him why he doesn’t shower more often, he said he “can’t be bothered” as he doesn’t get stinky. That is true. He’s lucky he doesn’t suffer from body odour. He wears deodorant and brushes his teeth twice a day. He also doesn’t get greasy hair or look unpolished. It’s just that now I know he is shower-shy, I can’t unknow it. I don’t like the idea of Jake living in my flat and walking around having not washed for half a week I shower every day – I suppose that women are held to higher beauty standards. It’s not really my business to tell him how to care for his body, but I don’t like the idea of Jake living in my flat having not washed for half a week. He’s also a teacher and I get disturbed by the possibility of him bringing germs into my home from the unwashed kids he’s around every day. I don’t want to seem like a nag – I’m not his girlfriend or his mother – but I want him to get that, as a grown man, he needs to wash more often. I think most people will agree that twice a week isn’t enough. I don’t want to shame Jake, but maybe just a little bit of shame will help him see sense. Our parents live a long way away, and I’m not going to tattle on him as we have a good relationship and the living situation is generally quite peaceful. However, it’s not the Victorian era. I have a lovely bathroom. Jake needs to clean up his act. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes","I’m not dirty, I don’t smell, so what’s the problem? Plus overwashing is bad for your skin I hate to sound like a scruff but I don’t think it’s necessary to have a shower every day. Call me a weirdo but I have better things to do. Especially when I don’t smell. I take good care of my clothes and put deodorant on every day. I also don’t really sweat much on a day-to-day basis unless I exercise, which I do around twice a week – and I’ll always shower afterwards. It’s just that if I haven’t exercised, or have just got home from work, I usually won’t take a shower. There just isn’t the time to shower daily. In the evenings I’m too tired, and in the morning I’m rushing out the door to school. If I don’t exercise, I will shower every three to four days. I don’t really see a problem with that. My hair never gets greasy and I guess it all just comes down to not being bothered. I do feel like she has taken this issue and run with it … Is my showering really any of her business? Yes, I am lazy and see showering as a chore. Our mum is very clean so I don’t get it from her, but when my dad was working full-time, he would always complain about showering and said it took up too much of his time. Maybe I inherited his hatred of bathing. I also think it’s good to let the natural oils of the body sit on your skin. Overwashing is worse as it strips them off – I read that somewhere. I also think your body is largely self-cleaning in a way. Isla should be happy because lower shower frequency helps keep the water bills down – she pays most of the bills as it’s her flat. I think living on my own for a few years made me less aware of how strange not bathing every day is to some people. I do feel like she has taken this issue and run with it, though. Is my showering really any of her business? Isla worries that I could be bringing germs home from school, but I always make sure to change into pyjamas or casual wear when I get in and wash my hands before cooking. I don’t get any other complaints from Isla regarding us living together, so it’s not like I’m a dirty person. Showering just feels like a super big chore to me.",innocent,medium
"I find it offensive when Anya tops up my tip in a restaurant – if I’m paying she should follow my lead Whenever we go out to a restaurant, my daughter Anya and I will have an argument about tipping. If I take her out for a meal, I’ll pay and leave a tip that I believe to be fair – usually 5% of the bill – unless the waiter has been exceptionally good. In that case, I might tip 10 or 15%. Anya says I should be paying more, but I do what I believe is right. Recently we visited Bali, and ate out at a restaurant that added a 10% service charge to the bill. But Anya wanted us to tip more, and when I refused she topped up the payment with her own money. If I’m taking us out, I think she should go with what I want to do – that’s the polite thing to do. I don’t have a problem with service charges being added to a restaurant bill. I just think that waiters generally receive good salaries across Europe, so tipping is not a necessity. I’m from Moscow and there’s a different standard there: tips are seen as a bonus; they top up your usual salary if you’ve worked extra hard. It’s down to how the client feels, and how the waiter performs. We have separate values, and that’s fine, but why can’t she adopt my values when we are out for dinner together? It shouldn’t be on the customer to support the waiting staff’s salary, unless they do something really impressive. In my opinion, to receive a tip you need to do more than just serve the food and take away the plates. There shouldn’t be an expectation that you will receive the tip, otherwise you won’t go above and beyond in your role. This issue first came up when I divorced Anya’s father eight years ago, and became more conscious of how I spend my own money. In restaurants, I get annoyed with Anya when she doesn’t follow my lead. We have different values, and that’s fine, but why can’t she adopt my values when we are out for dinner together? I like eating out with Anya and I don’t mind paying for her, but I don’t want to discuss this with her every time. If she leaves a big tip on top of what I’ve already paid, I try not to tell her off but it’s hard, because I feel like it is a bit disrespectful. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes","Mum needs to realise it’s not about her. Giving more money helps me live up to my values I really enjoy dining out with my mum, and I am grateful for all the lovely meals. But I also believe I should be able to do what I want with my money. I don’t think I need to follow her rules. I never tell my mum that she needs to leave a tip if she’s taken me out for dinner. Most of the time, I’ll use my own money because I believe her tip is inadequate. I don’t put any pressure on her to tip more than she wants to. She can spend her money how she sees fit. But I am 30, and if I want to tip a waiter, I will. I think she gets annoyed with me because she sees it as me being disrespectful. I know it might look a bit insulting, but I just don’t think that her 5% is enough. I’ll add more to make it up to 15 or 20%. That’s not ludicrous – it’s the industry standard. I’ve worked in bars and restaurants for many years, so I know the value of tips. People in service jobs rely on them When were in Bali, I tipped more because everything was already really cheap, so I wasn’t going to miss the extra £5 or £10 I tipped. Me tipping extra doesn’t undermine how I feel about my mum. If she wants to invite me for a meal I will gratefully accept, but that does not give her a right to tell me how to spend or not spend my money. I’ve worked in bars and restaurants for many years, so I know the value of tips to waiting staff. People in the hospitality industry rely on them – they make such a difference to your pay packet and motivate you to work harder. A lot of workers do long hours, have little in the way of career progression and sometimes live in precarious conditions. There should be more protection for workers in general, and salaries should be higher for waiters. I’d love it if workers didn’t have to rely on tips, but until that happens I believe that if you can’t afford to tip, you shouldn’t go out for a meal. I want to help my mum to see that me adding an extra little tip on top of her bill isn’t about her. It just makes me feel good and helps me live up to my values.",innocent,medium
"I’m in the office four days out of five, while Richard works at home and racks up the energy bills My flatmate and friend Richard works from home as a full-time copywriter, while I have a job at a property firm, and go into the office four days a week. We have lived amicably together for nearly four years but see the world quite differently, especially when it comes to bills. I think things should be equitable, rather than equal. Richard is more of a “it all comes out in the wash” kind of guy, which was all well and good until he started working from home more. After the pandemic, he didn’t go back to the office at all, whereas I did. And so, with the changes in our routines, I thought it would be fairer if he paid a bit more towards the bills. I mentioned it in passing around two years ago, but we didn’t end up doing it. We earn about the same, so I don’t think it’s a huge deal. I’d also be open to doing it only during the winter months My concern with bills mostly comes up in winter, when Richard likes to run the heating all day. He says he doesn’t, but the bills suggest otherwise. Last year we got a bill of over £100 in January and I wasn’t even here – I was travelling. I still split it with Richard, but I wasn’t happy. I’d like to avoid doing that this year by splitting the electricity and heating 60/40. Of course it’s impossible to work out kilowatts per person, but I think my suggestion is more than fair as Richard is home almost all the time and doesn’t like to travel like I do. Along with his laptop and the constant boiling of the kettle – he drinks eight cups of tea a day – he also likes to run a dehumidifier in our flat. I support that, but it all helps to rack up the electricity bill. This sounds like I’m complaining about his habits but I’m really not. I just think if he wasn’t working from home, our bills would be a lot lower, and I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask someone to pay their share. Richard was open to doing this before, but now it’s come down to it, he has told me I am “tighter than a duck’s arse”. I don’t think that’s fair. We earn about the same, so it’s not a huge deal. I’d also be open to doing it only during the winter months, because that’s when the bills are higher. Hopefully readers will support me on this one and see that this is the fairest way to live with a flatmate.

A 50/50 split is fair Maeve and I are both 33 and have lived in house shares before. I’ve never heard of the kind of setup she is proposing and think it’s a bit ridiculous. She first suggested changing our bills back in 2022, when she went back to the office after lockdown and I stayed at home, but I fobbed her off back then. Now she’s bringing it up again. I reckon she’s a bit jealous because I work from home all the time and her office doesn’t allow it. She’s also panicking because our bills went up recently, by about £60 a month. But that’s not that much – only £30 each. I have suggested switching electricity and heating providers to find something cheaper, but Maeve says her stance would be the same even if we did, because I work from home full-time and, to her, it’s not “fair”. I can understand the heating issue. I did say that I’d turn it on less, or just for half the day I find this a bit hypocritical as she has her boyfriend stay over a lot, which pushes the price of everything up. But you don’t see me counting how many showers he has when he’s here, or how often they turn the oven on to cook, or how long they watch TV. Maeve said I run the dehumidifier all day, but that benefits her too, as it sucks moisture out of the air in a communal space. She also mentioned that when I’m at home I like to drink tea, but doesn’t everyone? How can we police how many cups of tea you’re allowed to make? I can understand the heating issue. I did say that I’d turn it on less, or just for half the day, so it’s not just me benefiting from it. But Maeve likes to have it on when she sleeps. I think that’s a waste of money, and would prefer to turn it off before bed. My point is, our differences really do all come out in the wash. Keeping tabs is silly because we could go on and on point-scoring like this. I haven’t raised all this with Maeve until now – I’m hoping she gets it and that people side with me. When you live with a friend, you split everything down the middle. I think that’s the fairest way. Maeve is panicking because the bills have gone up, but that’s no one’s fault. We should keep things as they are, or switch providers.",innocent,medium
"If Fernanda’s dog moves in, my cat will get stressed and not come home. That would break my heart Fernanda and I are engaged to be married and have been in a lovely relationship for two and a half years. Fernanda moved in with me in March last year – my house is also home to my son, Dylan, my dog, Daisy, and my rescue cat, Michael. Fernanda has a rescue dog, Roo, who I’ve banned from living with us because she chases Michael. Michael gets on really well with my dog but he’s not a fierce cat and always runs away when something upsets him. Last year Fernanda had a night out with friends, and brought Roo around so I could look after her. It was a complete disaster. Roo would not settle down. At night her barking disturbed my sleep so I put her and Daisy in the lounge. Then, Fernanda stumbled in drunk at 2am, went to bed and slept through Roo’s barking. The next morning there was uproar when Roo spotted Michael and chased him out of the kitchen. It was awful. There was so much barking and scuffling. Michael ran to my neighbour’s house and didn’t return for three days. Roo now lives at Fernanda’s ex’s house, 20 minutes away, and Fernanda visits him often, so it’s not like Roo doesn’t have a home After that, I said Roo couldn’t live with us. My heart hurts for Fernanda, but Michael is my baby and this is his home. If we have Roo here, Michael will get stressed out and run away again. That would break my heart. Roo now lives at Fernanda’s ex’s house, 20 minutes away, and Fernanda visits him often, so it’s not like Roo doesn’t have a home. Fernanda wants to get an expert in to help Roo and Michael coexist, but that sounds like such a palaver. You have to crate them and get them used to each other by slowly moving the cages closer together. I think it would be horrible; Michael’s never been in a cage and Roo wasn’t crated when she was little. I accept Fernanda has had to sacrifice more in our relationship, but it’s because I own my home and I have a son, so the only option was for her to move in with me. I do love Roo as she’s a lovely dog. My heart hurts for Fernanda, but I’ve had Michael since he was a kitten, and I don’t want to make him feel uncomfortable in his own home.","I’ve put in more effort to adjust to Vivienne’s life than she has to mine. Roo just needs training Roo is my baby and my child, just like Michael is Vivienne’s child. Except I have to drive 20 minutes three times a week to see my baby as she lives with my ex. It’s getting tedious. I’ve been doing it for three years, but Vivienne won’t welcome Roo into our home. The night it all kicked off was a mistake on my part. I should never have gone out. All my school friends were in town from abroad and I didn’t want to miss out. That night disturbed Vivienne’s sleep and upset Michael. Roo sometimes needs a stern telling off, and Vivienne doesn’t have a stern voice. But that was more than a year ago, before I even moved in, and that was the last time Roo was allowed in the house, which I think is unfair. Vivienne needs to be open to the possibility that the animals can get along. She makes it harder than it needs to be. I tolerate Michael bringing dead animals into the kitchen. I’ve put in more effort to adjust to Vivienne’s life than she has to mine. I’d be happy to get a pet whisperer in to help the animals get on, but she has said: “That’s too hard, we can’t do it.” When Michael goes to stay with a neighbour, it’s only ever for a maximum of two or three days, but Vivienne will be absolutely distraught. She needs to be open to the possibility that the animals could get along. She makes it harder than it needs to be. Roo is an English pointer crossed with a labrador. She’s smart, playful and I think she’d learn to adapt really quickly. I really miss her. My ex was out at a Christmas party recently so I was able to go around and sit on the couch with her. Just having her head nestling on me is special. I miss the quiet, in-between times when we cuddle or throw a ball. Vivienne should be more open to allowing Roo to come for a long weekend, then the animals could get to know each other. But Vivienne won’t even entertain it. I haven’t started looking for expert help yet because it will be too heartbreaking to do all the research and then have Vivienne say no. What with visiting and then having to leave Roo, I already get heartbroken three times a week.",innocent,medium
"Gabriel may well be targeting the right people, but that doesn’t justify his obsessive online antics Gabriel, my boyfriend of seven years, is an internet troll and I don’t find it cute. When we met he was already chronically online, as he worked in social media and made content for YouTube and TikTok on the side. I didn’t have a problem with it as he was focused on making sports content, but now he trolls all kinds of people. At first I liked dating someone who could communicate in memes and discuss the latest podcast drama, but now it’s getting out of hand. It’s not that I necessarily have a problem with who he trolls – it’s often horrible politicians or anonymous racist accounts – but I don’t think it’s good for him.

There are a lot of weirdos out there, and you will never win. Gabriel spends too much time online. I can hear him watching videos on his phone when he goes for a shower. I don’t know how many burner accounts he has, but I know it’s a few per app. He tells me it’s just a laugh, but I think he needs to log off.","I’m standing up to bigots – there’s no harm in giving them a taste of their own medicine Being chronically online isn’t a crime. And neither is putting the world to rights in the comments section. Nelly is right, I do get a rush out of fighting with idiots, but only because there are so many out there. They need to be told. Online laws are too lax. Anyone can create an account and send racist or sexist abuse. There’s no control or repercussions. So if I can help make the world a better place by calling that behaviour out, I’ll do it. I don’t just start fights for the sake of it – I also block and report really nasty stuff. I work in social media and have my own official accounts where I make content about sports. I spend a lot of time online; it’s a big part of my personality. I’ve made money online and I’ve seen how going viral can really change people’s lives. I wouldn’t let someone call me incompetent or ugly in real life, so why would I let it slide online? When something of mine goes viral, I do go a bit giddy. Nelly used to get excited, too. Other times, it feels a bit much because the comments are non-stop. I have learned not to take the nasty stuff personally though. I don’t make as much content now because I don’t have time, but I took it really seriously in lockdown when we were home a lot. I made my burner accounts after experiencing trolling. When I replied, I got in trouble with the apps for being “abusive”. Once, my TikTok was shut down. I then realised I could make burner accounts and fight the trolls anonymously without jeopardising my main account. That’s why I have so many.

"She seriously considered planting Japanese knotweed in her former housemates’ garden My best friend Phoebe is obsessed with revenge and it has driven a wedge between us. Recently, on the way to the airport for a holiday in Greece together, we had a horrible taxi driver. He was rude and didn’t help us with our bags when getting into the car. He was on the phone for half the ride and ignored us when we asked him to change the radio station. After we got out, Phoebe said she had secretly slipped half a punnet of blueberries into the door compartment to “get her own back”. When I asked her what the point of that was, she said it made her feel better and that he deserved it. Perhaps he did, but I don’t get why she would actually do that. If we all went around doing what we felt like, the world would be chaos. Phoebe says I don’t understand her because she’s a Scorpio. When we were 14 she egged someone’s house after they were racist to her mum Phoebe always thinks revenge is the best answer. When we were teenagers she hacked into her ex’s MSN account and deleted it when she found out that he’d cheated on her. Another time, when we were about 14, she egged someone’s house after they were racist to her mum. She waits, and then she strikes. I’m not saying her actions weren’t justified, but I believe that walking away with your head held high is always the better option. I am definitely calmer. I have to talk sense into Phoebe when her thirst for revenge clouds her judgment. One time she was living with some horrible people in a house share and had to move out after they’d bullied her. They owned the house, and Phoebe was seriously considering returning to their garden in the dead of night to plant Japanese knotweed , a plant that is famously hard to get rid of and can even damage building foundations. Obviously I didn’t agree with how her housemates treated her, but I don’t think they deserved that. I was also worried about Phoebe getting herself in trouble. I aired my concerns and eventually she gave in. We are both 27 and should let go of obsessing over things that don’t bring us peace. Phoebe says “revenge brings me peace.” That notion is ridiculous.","I don’t regret any of my actions. Some call it revenge; I call it karmic rebalancing I don’t like being described as vengeful, but I do feel a sense of peace when I get my own back after someone has wronged me. It’s not like I go around plotting evil acts for no reason. But if someone is unpleasant to me, I brood over it for weeks. I can’t let it go, and so I have to do something to snap myself out of it by readjusting the order of the universe. Some call it revenge; I call it karmic rebalancing. When it came to the Uber driver, Priya also felt he was very rude, but she would never do anything about it because she’s less confrontational. She also doesn’t hold a grudge. I like that about her, but it gets tiring always being the friend who has to stick up for us. It sometimes feels as if she judges me for doing it. I tell Priya it’s all because I’m a Scorpio – we are stubborn and loyal and we often seek revenge I slipped a few rotten blueberries into the side pocket of the driver’s car – so what? I’d do it again. It’s not enough to just leave a bad review – people need to feel a little burn. Same thing with my ex who cheated on me. I don’t regret my actions in any of these cases. I’d do them again. I tell Priya this is all because I’m a Scorpio – we are stubborn and loyal and we often seek revenge. I appreciated Priya talking sense to me the time I was about to spread knotweed. She told me I would have got myself in trouble, and she was right. At the time I was upset and not thinking clearly. It’s just that sometimes, when I’m really upset, I get so consumed by the need to right a wrong done to me. They say that revenge is a dish best served cold, but I was white hot with rage. Priya is a Virgo, so I just don’t think she gets it. I would never act like this towards my family or close friends – it’s just the people I don’t know very well, those on the edges of my life or anyone who commit a colossal betrayal. I guess I’ve always been like this. I could work on it a bit, as it can come across as childish. But we are all works in progress, aren’t we?",guilty,high
"Thoughtful gestures mean less if they’re not spontaneous. And flowers are a scam My girlfriend, Margaret, absolutely loves flowers. We met on an app and her profile said something like: “Red roses make me happy”. I brought red roses for her on our third date because I wanted to impress her. Obviously she loved them and we’ve been together for three years. Ever since, she’s always trying to get me to buy her flowers. On birthdays or anniversaries, she gets annoyed if I don’t. Margaret’s love language is gift-giving, with a special emphasis on flowers and jewellery, but I can’t do that all the time. I think it makes the relationship more special when you do things of your own accord. I like to show love with my words and quality time, so I think arbitrary acts of romance, such as buying things, are a bit shallow. Margaret says I’ve dropped my standards since we got together, but that’s not true. I just don’t think it’s practical to expect the same thing all the time. These gestures mean less, too, if they’re not spontaneous or things that I’ve decided to do in my own right. I show my love in other ways. For Margaret’s birthday, I got us tickets to a nice rooftop bar and a show. But she still mentioned the lack of roses Besides, I show my love in other ways. This year, for her birthday, I got us tickets to a nice rooftop bar and a show, but Margaret still mentioned the lack of roses. She said I should set up a flower delivery service on direct debit so I will never forget. I know she would like flowers from me every week, but I’m not that guy. I don’t even like flowers, if I’m honest. They represent death, serve no point and are inherently depressing. The second you buy them, you’re counting down the days until they die. You have to cut the stems, rearrange them, water them and get the plant food. Then three days later, they start wilting. It’s so much effort for temporary beauty. Flowers are a scam, as are so many other aspects of modern romance. We’ve argued about this a few times. I think we should focus on trying to show our love in ways that benefit both of us – such as having more fun dates. I’d be happier to spend my money on that, instead of wilting roses that cost £20 a dozen.","Why not buy your partner something they like? I don’t get Darren’s weird aversion to flowers Flowers seem to really trigger Darren and I’m not sure why. When we first got together he was really keen to buy them for me, but over the past three years he seems to get annoyed whenever I remind him that I like them. Flowers are just lovely. They brighten up a room and they remind you of the gifter. Darren is considerate in many ways, but if I drop hints that he should get me roses for my birthday, he’ll say: “I don’t want to be forced into it.” I think that if you know what makes your partner happy, you should try to do that to keep the spark alive. For example, I know that he loves it when I cook him a meal. Me being caring, through acts of service, is how he likes love to be expressed. I like that as well, but I also love thoughtful, tailored gifts. A year ago Darren got me a personalised gold bracelet and some roses for our second anniversary. I thought that was really special. But now he likes to buy me things we can do together. He will get us a voucher for a spa weekend or a date night to the theatre. While I appreciate these things, I also think it’s a little selfish because those presents involve him. Darren likes to buy me things we can do together. I think it’s a little selfish because these are those presents that also involve him He thinks roses are “pointless” because they die quickly, but I like them, so it shouldn’t really matter. When it was my birthday recently, I made a point of asking for flowers, and I was a little annoyed when I didn’t get any. Darren says he forgot because he was planning this theatre night, but I don’t believe him. My suggestion that he sign up to a flower delivery service was borne of frustration. If he did that, I’d never be disappointed. He says a delivery service will take all the fun out of romance, but I think he’s just being stubborn. My friend said Darren and I are incompatible because we have very different love languages. I don’t think that’s true, as everything else is generally good, but I don’t really get why he’s dragging his heels with this one thing. I wonder if he had an ex who used to make him buy flowers or something. He says he doesn’t but I’ve never met anyone who is so opposed to the concept of flowers.",innocent,medium
"It’s ridiculous. We share everything, so taking the air-fryer and blender is unfair – and weird When I moved into my flat-share with my mate, Ronan, 18 months ago, we were broke art students. The flat came with basic furniture, like a bed and a sofa, but no appliances, so we invested in some. I found a few bits secondhand on Facebook Marketplace. I got a really good deal from someone throwing out a brand-name toaster, microwave and kettle set, while Ronan bought a new blender and air-fryer. However, he’s now planning on going travelling for a few months this winter, and wants to take them with him. I find that a bit weird. I’m going to miss the air-fryer the most. We put everything from meat to potatoes in there We both use everything in the flat and it was sort of an unspoken agreement that we co-own all the furniture and appliances. But now Ronan says that as he bought the blender and air-fryer, he can take them with him. I think it’s ridiculous. We both use the blender for smoothies and juices. Though I’m going to miss the air-fryer even more. We have dinners together and put everything from meat to potatoes in there. It’s become a staple. Ronan is doing the digital-nomad thing for the winter and he says he needs these appliances to live well in his new place, but what about the place we currently share? I have agreed to let a mutual friend stay in his room while he’s away, so Ronan can have his room back when he returns. I think that’s a kind gesture on my part – and this is how he repays me. In the meantime, I’m just supposed to buy more appliances or suddenly change my way of cooking. It doesn’t make any sense. If I were going away on a trip, I wouldn’t take the kettle and the microwave. It’s selfish. I also buy a lot of the cleaning products and soaps in our flat, and I can’t see myself ever being so pedantic that I’d start claiming them when it’s convenient. We never split hairs over the cost of things 18 months ago, so why start doing it now? We both have decent jobs now and Ronan says I can afford to replace the appliances, but when he gets back, we would have two of each.","It’s not as if I’m taking the oven and the microwave. Besides, I’ll be back in March. Kyle will survive Kyle is making me sound really horrible, but I did spend a lot on new appliances when we moved in, while he bought all his stuff secondhand. The blender cost me about £50 and the air-fryer was £45. In total, I probably spent £70 more than Kyle on kitchen appliances. When we found the flat, there was a lot to buy. So we bought our own stuff for our rooms and split the cost of a sofa, table and chairs. I’m not sure why we didn’t do that with the appliances, too. It was just a case of: you go and buy something we need, and I’ll go and buy something we need. I had a blender and air-fryer at my old place, so I took it upon myself to get them for the flat. Maybe I see the air-fryer and blender as more ‘mine’ because they were my idea To be fair, we didn’t say “that’s yours and this is mine” at the time of purchase, and we do both use pretty much everything in the flat. I can see why Kyle is annoyed, but I really need to take the appliances with me. Maybe I see the air-fryer and blender as more “mine” because they were my idea. I also cook quite a lot. Kyle has got used to having them, so now it’s time for me to take them abroad for a bit, he is annoyed. If we had split the cost of the appliances equally, the fairest way to sort this out would be to buy Kyle out by giving him back what he paid, and then take the items with me. But because I invested more at the start, I think I’m within my rights to take the air-fryer and blender whenever I want. He is also welcome to take the appliances he bought if he wants to move out or go travelling. It’s not like this works one-way. Also, I won’t be travelling for ever. I’m going to live abroad for a few months for winter and taking the appliances with me because I want to eat healthily while I’m away, but I’ll be back in March. Kyle says: “What am I supposed to do in the meantime?” But it’s not as though I’m removing the oven and the microwave. He can still make meals and live normally. If anything, I’m taking the non-essential appliances. He’ll survive. It will be fine.",guilty,medium
"I don’t want to lose my identity. Plus, changing your name is a load of admin I met Teddy on a dating app six years ago and we got married last year. He says he doesn’t want me to change my last name to his, but I can tell that he does really. My name is part of my identity. It’s important that if I wanted to apply for other jobs within my industry, people would recognise my name. I’ve worked hard to build up my reputation. My husband has one of the most common surnames in the UK, so my name wouldn’t be as recognisable. Also, changing your name is a load of admin. No one tells you this, but it takes a lot of time and money. I hadn’t thought about this before we married, and I doubt many men do either. I do see the point in having a name in common. It would be nice to have that connection with our future children However, I would be happy to go double-barrelled, because I can see the benefits of us having a name in common – it would be nice to have that connection with our future children. But Teddy doesn’t want that because he says it’s a “posh” thing. I think our names mesh well together, but he doesn’t like the sound of it. My mum was horrified at the prospect of me not taking Teddy’s surname. I still think it’s weird – it’s strange to see my married friends change their names on Instagram. I’m conflicted: I don’t want to lose who I am and my identity, but I don’t necessarily agree with us having different names either. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes We’ve reached an impasse, because Teddy isn’t willing to make any changes himself. From a feminist standpoint, I want him to change his name to mine. Nearly everyone around me says that’s not right – but why isn’t it? But I am slowly easing into it: I’ve changed my surname to Teddy’s on Instagram, but can’t bear the thought of changing it officially yet. Teddy’s mum changed her name twice when she got married: first she went double-barrelled, and then she dropped her surname and took her husband’s. Teddy said I could do that as a compromise, but that would be two lots of admin, which is a pain in the arse. I can’t see a way out of this.","I’m easy with whatever Annabelle wants, but don’t want to change my name. It’s just not the done thing I don’t mind if Annabelle keeps her surname and I keep mine, but if we have kids I’d like them to take mine, too. Annabelle doesn’t want that. She thinks we should go double-barrelled, or that I should change my name to hers. I’m easy with whatever she wants to do, but I don’t want to change my own surname. That was never on the cards, and I can’t see it happening. Annabelle’s mum is on my side. She was disgusted that Annabelle didn’t want to take my name Besides, the double-barrelled thing sounds really posh to me, which I don’t like. I also don’t think our names go well together. Annabelle disagrees, and thinks that double-barrelling is the best compromise, but I really don’t want that. I sympathise with her having to do all the admin, and I’d give her money to help pay for it all. She thanked me sarcastically when I suggested this, but I’m just trying to help. I don’t mean to patronise her, but I can’t see myself ever changing my name to hers – it’s just not the done thing. I watched my mum go double-barrelled after marrying, but then she eventually took my dad’s name. I’d be fine for Annabelle to do this as I’m not in a rush for her to take my name straight away. I feel like that’s a good compromise, but Annabelle thinks it’s too much hassle. Annabelle’s mum is on my side. She was disgusted that Annabelle didn’t want to take my name. I guess we are all quite traditional in that sense. I don’t have a reason for wanting it that way – it’s just how it’s always been. I won’t ever tell Annabelle what to do – at the moment we’re just letting it roll. We have a fairly relaxed relationship overall and don’t really argue. We didn’t talk about this stuff before we got married, as I just assumed Annabelle would be happy with the status quo. I guess most men are, because it benefits us. But when you sit down and think about it, there’s no real reason for this tradition. Saying that, though, I’m glad it exists because I want my name to be passed on through our children. Annabelle will probably come around. It’s just a matter of time.",guilty,high
"Amma and Dami should respect my penchant for cleanliness. The way we live is disgusting I have a thing about germs, and am very particular about sharing spaces, cutlery, clothes and towels. During the Covid lockdown, I actually moved back home with my family because I was so worried I would catch the virus from my flatmates. (Obviously I got it anyway.) My flatmate Amma calls me a germaphobe. She is way more relaxed than me. It’s the same with our other flatmate, Dami. I’ve known Amma for years, and we met Dami through mutual friends. We’re all cool, but they don’t understand the way I like to do things. For example, I don’t see why we have a shared hand towel in our bathroom. Everyone using the same wet rag? No, thank you. I carry my own personal towel in and out of the bathroom. They think that’s hilarious. Similarly, in the kitchen I am particular about not mixing up cloths and scrubbers. I want one cloth for washing plates that hasn’t had meat on them, and another for rinsing mugs and cutlery. There should be a third just for wiping down surfaces. I think: that cloth has been used to rinse the chicken pot, why are you dragging it over our dining table? We haven’t got a dishwasher and I’m always seeing bits of food on dishes that haven’t been washed properly. Amma and Dami just use any old cloth. I think: that one has been used to rinse the chicken pot, why are you dragging it over our dining table? Or: that is for scrubbing, why aren’t you scrubbing? I get told that I’m being “dramatic” and that antibacterial spray and soap will sort everything out. I disagree. I also think we should each have separate tea towels. I don’t like the idea of drying plates and bowls with a towel we’ve all touched. It annoys me that Dami uses the tea towel to dry his hands sometimes. The cross-contamination is mad. I’ve even watched Amma dry a mug with a tea towel and then use that same tea towel to wipe a crumb from her mouth. We’re adults and we shouldn’t be living like this. The tea towels and bath mat rarely get cleaned unless I wash them. Hygiene in a flatshare is really important and I find all this mixing up of cloths really disgusting.","Life’s too short to be hung up about tea towels – Isioma needs to stop overthinking everything Isioma is a very good flatmate. She’s always trying to improve the flat and tops up the things I forget to buy, like milk. Dami and I always pay her back and we don’t ever argue about money, but she overthinks a lot of the stuff to do with cleanliness. Why is she having a go at us over a hand towel she doesn’t even use? Dami and I have decided between us to keep a shared hand towel in our bathroom, and we wash it as and when we need to. I don’t know why Isioma is still fussing. Not having a shared hand towel is weird, especially when we have guests over. And I’m not carrying my own towel in and out of the bathroom every time I want to wash my hands. If Isioma wants to do that, that’s her prerogative. We don’t spend all of our time thinking: which cloth shall we use? I’m not that concerned over the kitchen cloths, either. When we wipe down a surface, we all spray it with antibacterial spray beforehand. That kills all the germs. After we’ve wiped it down, we then rinse it out. Separating cloths for every little thing we need to wash is unnecessary and annoying. As long as the cloth is clean, I believe it is fine to use it to wash whatever I like. Dami and I aren’t dirty just because we don’t spend all of our time thinking about which cloth to use. The world isn’t going to collapse if one of us uses the wrong one. Isioma says we don’t wash the cutlery properly, so, as a compromise, I think we should get a dishwasher. Small countertop ones are quite affordable. Isioma doesn’t want to contribute to one because she says when we move out there will be an argument about who gets to keep it. But we can cross that bridge if we come to it. For now, I think that would make things a little less stressful in the kitchen. And Dami and I have said that we will take more of an interest in washing the communal tea towels, bathroom towels and the mats. Other than that, I don’t want to waste too much time worrying about it all. Life is too short to be bothered about specialty cloths.",innocent,medium
"Rog doesn’t get drunk in the theatre, but my reputation could suffer if he’s seen taking a swig I work in a theatre and get free tickets to a lot of shows. But every time I bring my husband Rog, we have the same discussion about him sneaking in his hip flask. I love Rog, and I like how he’s good at smuggling drinks into festivals and events. He’s very good at making things fun and helping us save money, but I’d rather not have him be known as “the guy with the hip flask” at my place of work. Every time I take him to a show, Rog wants to bring in “Mr Aspinal”, a little flask in a leather case. I’m not worried about his drinking – he likes a drink socially and I suppose the theatre is a social occasion for him. Rog says he has an emotional attachment to Mr Aspinal because it was a wedding present from his best man, but I don’t think that justifies it. It’s embarrassing. There are also often free drinks at press nights anyway, so it’s unnecessary. It wouldn’t be so bad if I didn’t work in theatre, but when we’re attending a press night, or we’re with people we know, I want to make a good impression. I’ve just started a job at a new theatre and I don’t want friends and colleagues to think we are cheap. I feel it’s reasonable to ask that Mr Aspinal stays at home. In my wedding speech, I said Rog brings the fun, that he’s the ‘chief entertainment officer’ in our relationship When Rog and I first started dating, I took him to see Waiting For Godot at a theatre festival in Wales. Throughout the play I heard him opening tinnies. It was quite jarring, but because it was early days, I didn’t say anything. Eight years later, we are now married and things have progressed to the hip flask. It’s more discreet than opening a can of beer, but I just can’t bear the thought of him sneaking drinks into my theatre and someone seeing him. In my wedding speech, I said Rog brings the fun, that he’s the “chief entertainment officer” in our relationship. I love him for that, but it would distract from my work and affect my reputation if people saw him take a hip flask out and take a swig from it during a performance. I’d really like the backing of Guardian readers on this matter.","As long as I’m being discreet, what does it matter to Ellen what other people think? I don’t think it’s unreasonable to bring out a hip flask in the theatre. Mr Aspinal is very classy and very demure. He’s in a leather pouch and I think he’s very civilised. Everyone used to have a hip flask back in the day. It was like wearing a trilby – it’s a sign of days gone by. I’m very lucky to be Ellen’s plus-one to the theatre. I’ve seen some great productions. I take Mr Aspinal along with me because with a hip flask you can just have a little nip here and there. You don’t have to wait until after the show. I want to emphasise that I buy drinks in the theatre as well. I would always buy a glass of wine, even when I’ve got Mr Aspinal. It’s not as though I’m trying to cheat the arts sector out of drinks money. I’m also responsible with my drinking: I’m a serious professional – a teacher – and I’d never get drunk at these events. But it’s nice to have your own little pouch of booze. I usually fill Mr Aspinal up with whisky or rum, but mezcal is my favourite. Mr Aspinal has great sentimental value to me, because it was a gift from my best man when I married Ellen. The bigger issue is why she cares about the opinions of others. Strangers shouldn’t care about me bringing a hip flask in When it comes to the tinnies I took to a show on one of our early dates, I didn’t realise it was a faux pas, but I was teased later on. On reflection, the can-opening noise was quite loud and I admit it was the wrong thing to do. I wouldn’t do that now. But I do ask Ellen each time she invites me if I can bring the hip flask. She keeps saying no. So far I have never gone against Ellen’s wishes. The last thing I want to do is make her feel uncomfortable, or feel as if she’s jeopardising her professional reputation. But the bigger issue is why she cares about the opinions of others. Strangers shouldn’t care about me bringing a hip flask in. And as long as I’m not making a fool out of myself, Ellen shouldn’t care either. I don’t think we should be so worried about the judgment of others. Saying that, I am interested to see if readers agree with me.",guilty,high
"It’s embarrassing seeing Harriet’s bras and pants lying around the flat when people come over My mate Harriet lives with me in our shared rented flat. We’re pretty close and have been since university, when we met on our history course. We work well together as flatmates. We moved in together two years ago but we are quite different. I’m fairly organised and private, but Harriet loves to air her dirty laundry in public – literally. We have a tiny flat with no garden and a limited number of shared spaces, and Harriet is constantly drying her clothes on the radiators. I think this is embarrassing – especially when it’s her underwear. I’ve had girls I’ve been seeing back at the house and they have asked: ‘Whose bras are these?’ It’s not that I have a problem with seeing women’s underwear, I just don’t think it looks particularly inviting when we have people round. I have had girls I’ve been seeing back at the house, and they have asked, “Whose bras are these?” because Harriet will sling them over every radiator. One time she even came into my room and put her stuff on my radiator. I’d brought someone home with me, and it got awkward. We are close mates, so it’s not that I see it as a violation, but it’s a bit much when you are having to explain your relationship with your flatmate to other women. Winter is approaching now, so it will get worse. It’s cold, we’ve got nowhere to hang our clothes and Harriet seems to do a wash every other day. There is literally no free space for me to hang my clothes up. I reckon Harriet’s habits are bad for our central heating bills. She put the radiators on in early October, before it was even cold, just to dry her clothes. She has a drying rack but says things don’t dry quickly enough and that it takes up space in her tiny room. Also, putting clothes over every radiator prevents the flat from fully warming up. My solution is to go to a launderette or split the cost of a tumble dryer, but Harriet won’t hear of it. She says: “I’m not paying to dry my clothes!” I don’t think I’m particularly uptight or unreasonable. I just don’t love seeing Harriet’s underwear all over the place. She could at least just dry that in her room. I think most people will agree with me.","I don’t have the money to buy a dryer, and there’s not enough space in my tiny room We live in a small flat and we have to dry our clothes inside. It’s not that controversial. If you don’t have a garden, you don’t have a choice. Drying clothes on the radiator doesn’t affect its efficiency or how quickly the house heats up in the winter, and I’m not paying to go to a launderette or saving up for a tumble dryer. I don’t have the money. I don’t see the issue with putting my underwear and other items on a radiator when there’s very little space in our flat. Will is more easily embarrassed than me, so when we have guests he’ll say: “Put all those clothes in your room. The place looks messy.” I always oblige but honestly, I otherwise wouldn’t bother as I don’t really care what people think. Sometimes it’s our mutual friends. They have never, ever said anything about clothes drying on radiators. It’s a normal sight. Drying clothes on the radiator doesn’t affect how quickly the house heats up in the winter In the case of him bringing a date back, I get it. He wants the flat to look tidy and he also doesn’t want them to think that I am his girlfriend. I thought the time I dried my bras and pants in Will’s room while he had a girl over was pretty funny. He didn’t get angry but after she left he said: “Can you tell me in advance next time you’re going to do that?” It’s fair enough. She had obviously thought it a bit weird, but I’d done a really big wash and was desperate. The thing is, Will also hangs his clothes on our radiators, so I don’t think it’s particularly fair to ban me from doing it if he’s not also going to stop. I don’t tell him to hide his underwear, but he seems to have an aversion to looking at mine. I could dry those items in my room to make him comfortable, but I don’t really like unfolding a big drying rack for that, as my room is really small. I do have a radiator in there, but there’s not enough space for everything. I could try to use the drying rack for my underwear, but only as long as Will does the same. And seeing as his room is bigger than mine, maybe we could put the rack in his room. That sounds like a good compromise to me.",guilty,medium
"Polly is so over-attentive to our new cat that it’s getting in the way of our sex life Just over a week ago, my girlfriend Polly and I found a kitten abandoned on the roadside, so decided to take it in. It was about four weeks old and we’ve named it Tagus. While I’m loving looking after Tagus, I’m also keen to protect our own lives as a couple. In order to do that, Polly and I have tried to set some boundaries with Tagus – but I’m clearly better at that than her. I’m more pragmatic, more cold. My approach is: give love at one point, be distant another. I want to put the kitten in her cage (we call it the “casa”) for three to four hours during the day, and all night while we sleep. Polly is more anxious. We’re supposed to let Tagus out of her casa at 7am, but Polly will hear her whining at 5.30am and get up – but then she makes me go out to look after the cat. Polly gets all the cat love in this new relationship, but I feel like I’m doing more of the work. Sometimes I will go out on the balcony with the cat and Polly will get really angry I want Polly’s attention, and to preserve the romance in our relationship. But I can feel this other thing seeping in, and that thing is the cat. We recently had a romantic weekend away, and bought a huge pack of condoms for it, but ended up not using any because that was the weekend we found the cat. Tagus wandered over to us when we were on our way there, and then the whole weekend was just about her. Polly doesn’t want to have sex whenever there’s someone within 50 metres of us, as the walls in our house are thin. But now the cat is always within two metres of us, so it’s affecting our love life. I actually don’t know if we will ever have sex again. We live in a third-floor apartment. Sometimes I will go out on the balcony with Tagus and Polly will get really angry. She feels it isn’t safe. But I hold Tagus really carefully. The less concerned I am, the more concerned Polly becomes. It’s a push and pull. This cat is going to stress her out for 20 years unless she learns to relax. I don’t think she needs to be so highly strung. We can’t put our lives on hold for this little cat.","The cat needs love and affection and I’m the one who gives her that. Sirius is the disciplinarian We’ve only owned Tagus for a short while, but we’ve become obsessed with her and love her so much. However, Sirius and I have already had a lot of disagreements about how best to parent her. We have different approaches. I stress over her because I want her to be happy. I don’t like to hear her moaning early in the morning, so I will get up and break routine by letting her out of the cage. I’ll give her a snuggle, and then I will go back to bed and ask Sirius to look after her. Tagus sees me as the person who gives her the love and Sirius as the disciplinarian. She has a special whine that gets me out of bed now. It’s more high pitched than her usual one. I’m just giving her the love she deserves, but Sirius says the cat is getting more love than him right now. Maybe the affection I’m giving to Tagus has replaced the affection I should be giving to him When we first adopted the cat, she was in the room with us loads, so I couldn’t have sex. It’s true that the cat has affected our sex life, but hopefully that’s only temporary. The other weird thing is that Sirius has started to say that I treat him like the cat. He says I kiss him on the head in the same way I kiss Tagus. Maybe the affection I’m giving to Tagus has replaced the affection I should be giving to him. Who knows. He says I’ve started parenting him like Tagus, but I’m not deliberately doing that. The thing with Tagus is that she is so small – she fits in the palm of my hand – so I worry for her safety. I hate it when Sirius walks on to the balcony with her – it really worries me. It feels like she’s not quite real yet and I’m scared Sirius will break her. He wants to take her into the bed, but I’m scared he will smother her. We just have different parenting styles. We love having the cat around, but I have sent her on a little holiday with a friend for a bit and that has been quite nice. Maybe I’m too nervous. But I don’t want Sirius to take Tagus on the balcony, especially when he’s a bit drunk. He needs to be more careful with her on a day-to-day basis and then I can relax.",innocent,medium
"If something has a ‘please take’ sign on it, Amala can’t ignore it even if it’s junk. She’s addicted! My flatmate Amala works in costume and set design, so she’s always on the lookout for random things. But when she brings stuff off the street into our home, I get really annoyed. Why do we need other people’s crap? If there is something we need, I’d like to discuss it first. The other week she found an ugly painting in the road and said, “Shall we hang this up?” I hated it. It was a grey landscape in a chipped gold frame. A few months ago she brought a chair home. I asked her whether she should be worried about bed bugs, but she said she’d checked and it was fine. We kept it but I was quite paranoid, and made her clean and steam it with a special steam-cleaner she has for work. I also like having a cohesive look, decor-wise, and sometimes our flat feels very random It would only take one item to infect our whole flat, and I don’t think it’s worth the risk. Once she brought a kettle off the street which was really dirty, and a chest of drawers with all this rubbish inside. She does clean things out, but I’d like the cleaning to be done in the street before it comes into the flat. I also like having a cohesive look, decor-wise, and sometimes our flat feels very random. I moved in after Amala’s old flatmate moved out, so I had to adjust to the kookiness as it wasn’t “my” place. I’ve managed to put a bit of my own stamp on it now and Amala is understanding, but every now and then we will butt heads over her bringing something in off the street. She is part of all these “free stuff” groups on Facebook. That’s all well and good, but then she will get distracted and bring stuff home that we don’t need. The other week she brought three dying ferns and palms off the street into our place. If something has a “please take” sign outside it, she can’t just walk past, even if it’s junk. She’s like an addict. Amala also spends a lot of time on reselling websites, so she thinks that if we don’t want it, or it’s not for her work, she can make money on it. I would just like to be consulted before she brings stuff home. I don’t think that’s unreasonable.","Ruby’s a bit paranoid about cleanliness. Street thrifting is fun – that’s how I got the sofa she loves Ruby is lovely to live with, but she definitely has an issue with my job and all the stuff I accumulate while doing it. I’m a stylist and also work in set design, so I’m always getting ready to deck out a space (or a human). I spend a lot of time sourcing props and pieces, which I love, and Ruby is quite understanding when there’s a random pillar or giant painting in our living room. But she hates it when I go rogue and want to decorate our flat with things that are leftover from work, or that I find on the street. She has stopped me from bringing a perfectly good sofa into our home because she was paranoid about bugs. But the joke’s on her, because the one she sits on now was actually found on the street a long while ago. I got it before she moved in – it’s a squishy, yellow velvet sofa which everyone thinks is lovely. Ruby loves it. Surely that proves that street thrifting can be a worthwhile endeavour? There’s never anything actually dirty in our home. Ruby is just a bit paranoid because she doesn’t get it I honestly think Ruby can relax, because I always clean things before I bring them up to the flat. I’ve got professional cleaning equipment from my job. I steam-clean and I scrub. The chest of drawers did have some old empty food packets in one of the drawers, but it scrubbed up beautifully and we now have a nice piece of antique furniture in our living room. So it was worth it. With the plants, I was able to bring them back to life, and that saved on buying new ones. I would never bring a mattress into our home, and I always check for bed bugs. There’s never anything actually dirty in our home, Ruby is just a bit paranoid because she doesn’t get it. She works a normal nine-to-five, while I might be out cleaning rusty taps for a film set. It’s very different. Sometimes I think Ruby doesn’t understand why I do what I do, but I save us money when I source free bits of furniture, and if she doesn’t like something, I won’t insist on it staying in our flat. I get that Ruby and I live very different lives, but furniture thrifting is good fun.",innocent,medium
"We’ve already bought Rebecca expensive glasses. If she wants contacts too, she can pay My daughter, Rebecca, never wants to wear her glasses and it drives me mad. She’s 18, and at her age she really needs to look after her eyesight. I recently forced her to go to the opticians as she was complaining about not being able to see things in class. The optometrist said she’s shortsighted and needs glasses, but she refuses to wear them. I think it’s a ridiculous display of vanity. Rebecca will deliberately leave her glasses at home, even though I let her choose nice designer frames, costing more than £100. Her father and I have told her that contact lenses are a luxury, much like makeup She says she sits close to the front of class at school and doesn’t need to wear them every day. I’m concerned that not wearing them will make her eyesight worse. Rebecca has started researching laser eye surgery, which I think is so dangerous. We’re at a bit of a stalemate as she is asking if we will buy her monthlies, which cost £20 a month I wouldn’t fund anything like that, especially at her age. She wants contact lenses, but I said she’ll have to pay for those with her own money, which I think is fair. Her father and I have told her that contact lenses are a luxury, much like makeup. She usually buys her own makeup, using the money she’s earned from her part-time job in a cafe in our village. But Rebecca thinks we should pay for her contact lenses as, apparently, that’s what her best friend has her parents do. She says contact lenses are not a luxury but rather a necessity, just like her glasses – and if we’re prepared to pay for those, then why not the contacts, too? She’s started getting free contact lens samples from various local opticians. She has probably gone to every single one within a 10-mile radius of home and will run out soon. We’re at a bit of a stalemate as she is asking if we will buy her monthlies, which cost £20 a month. I said no, and while Rebecca isn’t sulking, she is bugging me. I’m against it. It’s not like her dad and I are tight parents – we bought her a new iPhone, and she gets clothes and makeup at Christmas. We just think that anything outside that, including contact lenses, should be on her. Am I being unreasonable?","Lenses aren’t a luxury. I feel confident in them, and only need help paying for them until after uni I’m not trying to be an ungrateful brat – I just think that if Mum’s parental responsibilities extend to looking after my eyesight, I should have a say in what form that support takes. I’m grateful for her help booking the optician’s appointment and buying glasses, but I did tell her beforehand I’d rather have contacts. Mum has never worn them, so she sees them as an indulgent luxury, when in reality they are just an alternative to glasses. I like the glasses I chose. But I want a choice between them or contacts. I don’t think it’s asking for too much. I also feel sort of tricked. If I’d known it was a choice between glasses and lenses, I would have chosen lenses. I like wearing makeup and now that I can go out, I don’t want to cover my face with glasses in a nightclub or anything. Mum says I’ll have to pay for contacts myself, even though I know she and Dad have the money. That’s not to sound ungrateful; it’s just that £20 a month isn’t a huge deal to them, but it is to me as I only have a part-time job and am still at school. All my friends get their contact lenses paid for, so I don’t think it’s too much of an ask. I also feel sort of tricked. If I’d known it was a choice between glasses and lenses, I would have chosen lenses. At the optician’s, we only spoke about glasses. Then I was told if I wanted contact lenses I would need to have another eye test and appointment, and Mum said, “No we don’t need that.” I thought: “Woah, hang on.” Then later she told me it was going to be on me if I wanted to get contact lenses. To bargain a little, I think I will suggest they start a direct debit to pay for the lenses that can end when I leave university. Then, when I graduate and have more money, I can start paying for them myself. That’s my attempt at bargaining, but I don’t know how it will go. Mum is adamant that contact lenses aren’t needed right now, but they are vital to my development as a young adult. That’s not me being overdramatic; it’s the truth. I feel like Ugly Betty wearing glasses. I might even fail my exams if I have to wear them all the time, due to stress. And my mum wouldn’t want that.",guilty,medium
"I think Nia gets a kick out of pushing things to the last minute. She needs to take travel seriously My wife, Nia, has a fundamentally different approach to airport etiquette from mine and I find it incredibly stressful. She’s just last minute for everything, and it’s unnecessary. What bugs me the most is that Nia will always want to get on the plane last, after everyone else has boarded. She will say: “What’s the point in queueing? We’ll just end up sitting on the plane for longer.” But I think, why not take your seat instead of pushing it until the last second? I get nervous watching everyone board before me, and the stewards get annoyed with us. A couple of times when Nia has insisted that we board last, we’ve got on the plane to find there’s no more room for our bags in the overhead lockers. One time, after landing, we had to wait for everyone else to get off before we could get our bags, as they were stored 10 rows back. She got stranded in an airport in Italy because she was busy buying a pastry when she should have been boarding her plane There’s nothing to gain from being late or last in line in an airport, but Nia is adamant that it’s “fine”. She is more chilled than me. I like to be on time for everything. We’ve never missed a flight but that’s only because of me. I print out all our boarding passes and email photocopies of our passports to myself before every trip. Nia calls it a “dad move”, but it keeps us organised. She told me that before we met, she was in an airport in Italy and was buying a pastry when she should have been boarding her plane. She missed her flight. That is so silly. It would never happen on my watch. You’re supposed to get to the airport two hours before your flight if you’re travelling to Europe, but Nia always thinks 1½ hours is fine. I don’t like taking the risk because you never know what will happen. On a holiday to Budapest earlier this year I gave in to her preferences over catching planes, and we almost missed our flight. We had to sprint through the airport after being delayed at security. It was such a close shave, and all because she didn’t want to board too early. I think Nia gets a kick out of pushing things to the last minute, but she needs to take travelling seriously.","I don’t want to sit on a plane for longer than I have to. Boarding my way wastes less time That one time I missed a flight in Italy was on a girls’ trip. A friend had slept in, which held us all up. It’s not strictly true that I missed the flight because I was eating a pastry – the whole group missed it, and we all took the blame. I bought the pastry after we’d admitted defeat. Obviously, I don’t want this to happen when I travel with Raheem, but he is a bit of a Time Lord, especially when it comes to transport. I appreciate him printing out everything (even if it does remind me of my dad), but I don’t love how stressed he gets. My preference for arriving a bit later at the airport is because I want to waste as little time as possible. I’d rather be at home than in a queue, and I’d rather sit and watch everyone else board before me if it means less time spent on the plane. I don’t get why people want to line up like keen beans to take their place in a tiny metal box, cramped and bored and breathing in recycled air for an extra 30 minutes. I’d argue I’m more conscious of time than Raheem because I want to spend it wisely Raheem wants to be first in the queue and first to board. I think that’s weird. I don’t think it’s smart to be on a plane for longer than you have to. Yes, you take a bit of a risk with the space in the overhead lockers, but who cares? That time we didn’t have access to one nearby turned out fine: we just had to wait five minutes to get our bags after the plane landed. We’d still saved time by not boarding early. Raheem makes me sound like I have no awareness of time, but I’d argue I’m more conscious of it than him because I want to spend it wisely. Being late isn’t the aim of the game – it’s about minimising the time you spend on things you don’t want to do. Raheem is a worrier and I’m not. At our wedding he panicked when I was 20 minutes late, but that’s normal for a bride. Our recent journey to Budapest was fine. I suggested getting to the airport 1½ hours before the flight instead of 2½, as he wanted, and we made our plane. It was Raheem who forced us to run through the airport even though the boarding gate wasn’t closing. He just got stressed. We weren’t last to the gate and everything was OK. He just can’t handle plans that aren’t made by him. I think it’s a control issue.",guilty,medium
"Rami has offered to go halves on an electronic key fob – but he should pay for it all Rami is a good mate. We met at uni and he moved in to my place eight months ago when I had to remortgage my house and found the cost had gone up exponentially. I have a three-bed and am recently single, while Rami needed to find a new place after his old landlord sold up, so it made sense for both of us. We’re both 32 and like living together as we’ve got similar interests: kickboxing, going to the gym, cooking. We’re both pretty tidy, although I’m definitely less laid-back. Rami misplaces things – in particular, our house keys. I can’t tell you the number of times he has lost them. It’s ridiculous. He’s lost them on nights out, or just coming back from work. One time he left a set on the train. The first couple of times I gave him spares and didn’t ask him to pay for a new set because I had loads, but after that I would say: “Mate, this is on you.” He told me it’s because his old house had a smart lock, where you key in a code. And when he lived with his parents, they had a key box. He says he’s just not used to carrying around keys. One time he went out to meet a friend, and took the keys with him, so he locked me out completely As a compromise, I installed a key box outside the house, concealed in a little pouch by the front window. You put a code in to unlock the box and get the keys out. At first, I didn’t like the idea of having the keys right next to the front door, and wondered if people would be able to smash the box open, but I got used to it. But then Rami wouldn’t put the keys back into the box. He’d take them straight into the house. A couple of times when I came home, I couldn’t get in. I’d have to call him to open the door. One time he went out to meet a friend, and took the keys with him, so he locked me out completely. Rami needs to respect the key box. Now I’ve taken to carrying my own set of keys, which defeats the purpose. He has suggested getting an electronic key fob for our door. I’m not a huge fan of this idea – I don’t like how it looks and it’s expensive. Rami said he would pay half, but seeing as he’s the one who keeps losing keys, I don’t think I should have to pay for it at all.","I know I’m bad with keys but why should I pay the full price when I won’t be living with Mark for ever I’m not great with keys. At the previous two houses I lived in, I didn’t need to carry them around, so I’m not used to them. That’s my excuse. My ex said I have a brain like a sieve as I lose a lot of stuff, not just keys. I’ve lost my work phone this year and left my gym kit on the train. But I do have my head screwed on in most other areas. I cook for Mark whenever I can and I’m a very considerate housemate. I think I keep losing the keys because I was promoted recently. I’m in a quite high-pressure media job … although, to be honest, I wasn’t working in that role when I started losing them. Mark was quite understanding about it the first few times but then I continued to lose them and he lost patience. He said, “What’s going on with you?”, and I told him that I was under a lot of stress. Then, to make things easier, I paid for a key box to put on our porch. It meant we could just leave a set in the box as we came and went, so I didn’t have to take the keys out with me every time I left the house. It worked quite well for a while, but then I would forget to put the keys back inside it. Mark got locked out a couple of times because he was expecting the keys to be in the box. Once, when I arrived back to let him in, he called me a “muppet” and I had to apologise. That wasn’t my finest hour. Mark was quite understanding when I lost the keys the first few times but then he lost patience My latest suggestion is to get an electronic fob that works with a passcode. That’s what my old landlord had in his house, and it requires the least amount of brain power: all you need to do is memorise a code. Mark isn’t keen – he thinks it will ruin his Victorian front door and it’s expensive (about £150). I have offered to pay for half of this – it’s Mark’s flat, and I won’t live here for ever – but he got annoyed and said I should pay for the whole thing. But the fob will benefit both of us as neither of us will need to worry about keys or boxes, so I think it’s the fairest way of doing things. Failing that, I can try to be less forgetful when using the key box.",guilty,high
"We trained our dog to be gentle. Now we have a baby, why would we take such a huge risk? We got our big white German shepherd, Eddie, almost two years ago. He was a compromise: I wanted a second baby, but Roger said only if we could get a second dog. Roger is an amputee, and having a dog is great for his disability. Having to be at home more with our first baby was hard on him, so Eddie has been brilliant. Roger has taught him amazing stuff. When they go to the park together, a crowd will gather and watch them do tricks. Eddie’s recall is great and he hangs on Roger’s every word. But it was difficult, too, as at first Eddie didn’t get on well with our other dog, Kady, and having a puppy at the same time as a newborn is a challenge. Now Roger wants to enter Eddie in a German shepherd competition called IGP , a dog sport that evaluates tracking, obedience and protection. To join, he would need to start teaching Eddie bite work. I’m apprehensive. You hear of cases of German shepherds biting a family member. Eddie has learned not to bite: you can put your hand in his mouth and he’s really gentle. To undo that training would be really risky. Sometimes we agree on things and I think it’s sorted, then I find out Roger’s gone and done it behind my back Our baby can be unpredictable. What if he freaks Eddie out and it leads to a confrontation? One time, when Roger’s brother came in our back door and did a silly dance, Eddie really didn’t like it. If he had been trained to bite, might it have been worse? If Eddie thinks we are under threat, he might attack people. Also, legally, once you teach your dog to bite, you are personally liable for whatever they do. Our insurance would no longer be valid. We discussed all this but a few months ago Roger bought a bite wedge to start training Eddie without my permission. I was livid when I found it. I hid it in the changing table (somewhere Roger never goes) and he begged me to tell him where it was until I caved. Sometimes we agree on things and I think it’s sorted, then I find out he’s gone behind my back. While he has worked so hard with Eddie and he’s a brilliant dog, I don’t think competing should be an avenue for him. It’s not worth the risk.","Eddie will still be the same dog even if I teach him to bite, and him competing would fulfill my dream I’m pleased Helen said Eddie is well behaved, because he really is. Eddie is a boisterous male, but our baby can pull his tail and you would never be worried about him reacting. We bought him for £900 and someone once offered us £9,000 for him when they saw how well behaved he is. I don’t think learning to bite would make him any less safe. It’s genetics or fear that makes a dog attack. Police dogs don’t just randomly turn if they are well trained. Suppose the terrible thing happened and Eddie did go mad – if he’s trained to bite and then leave it, he will be safer than a dog who has never been trained. When you watch a police dog bite, its tail wags because it is actually having a really fun time. It’s a game to them. I am obsessed with Eddie: he forces me to go out and walk every day. He is the key to my mental and physical health Eddie forces me to go out and walk every day, which is key to my mental and physical health. I would love to quit my job and train dogs if I could, but the next step is to compete. IGP was developed as the breeding standard for German shepherds in Germany and has now evolved into a competition. It’s really choreographed: walk two steps, bite for three seconds, that kind of thing. It’s not aggressive. The dog is just having a good time in a perfectly controlled way, but Helen thinks it will be too risky with the dog at home afterwards. When I got the bite wedge for Eddie, I was a little drunk at the pub and just ordered it on a whim from Amazon. I think I was quite graceful and apologised to Helen for going behind her back but she says I pleaded and whined to have it back after she hid it. But as of now, the wedge is still in its packaging and hasn’t been opened. I asked IGP if Eddie could compete in all the other areas and not do the biting stuff, but they said no. I did think about training other dogs. I wondered if I could volunteer with the police, but the answer was no. I looked at other dog competitions like Crufts but border collies really dominate those. IGP is perfect, as it’s just for German shepherds. I really want Eddie to compete, but if we can’t get him biting, he’s not allowed to enter.",guilty,high
"Rob has now got a mullet and looks like an adult film star. It’s ugly and I have to see it every day If you love something about your partner – a quality or an attribute – and it makes you feel sexually attracted to them, your partner should try to keep that. It’s important to a relationship. But Rob doesn’t care that the thing I love about him is his corkscrew curls. I get upset every time he cuts them off. He recently cut his hair really short, and now looks like an 80s PE teacher or an adult film star. It’s like a mullet, and it’s awful. He thinks it looks cool but I feel burned. Rob said, “I know you don’t like it, but I don’t care,” which tells me he doesn’t think he should put any effort into how he looks. But now I have to look at this ugly haircut every day. I think he should have asked me before he cut it off. Hair is not just a matter of aesthetics to me; it signals who you are. When Rob has long hair, he’s telling people he doesn’t care about societal expectations. He does that, anyway, in the way he behaves – he’s not a traditional manly man, and I love that – but I like to see it reflected in his look, too. It signals a move away from my upbringing, where all the men had straight hair and were strait-laced. I am less turned on by Rob because of his hair, and he has to deal with that Hair, for men, isn’t a painful issue. Women’s bodies and appearances are so tightly controlled – men don’t get stigmatised for having body hair. So I feel that women should be able to say, “Oh, I prefer this about my partner.” I’m generally less attracted to Rob now. He says, “It’s my body, I can do what I want.” But he has to deal with the consequences of my body shutting down in response. I’m not going to leave him, but I am going to make a racket. We will probably have less sex. I believe both of us should both strive to keep the attraction alive in the relationship. We’ve been together for eight years and I do things for him, like shaving my legs, because he prefers it. Rob knows I’m not controlling, but I think he’s inconsiderate. It’s like not brushing your teeth when you’re in a relationship – it’s offensive. This hair thing isn’t about control – it’s about doing something nice for your partner.","It’s my body, and my rules. If I want to look like a 1980s PE teacher, then so be it I always like to look good, but I think I look particularly good with my new haircut. However, it’s a real sticking point for Becky and it shouldn’t be. I should be able to do what I want: it’s my hair, my body and my rules. Becky gets really upset whenever I cut my hair. It feels weird to be in the doghouse for getting my hair trimmed. The irony is, Becky can dye her hair bright red or green or whatever, and I don’t say a word. She dyed it red the other day, and I didn’t know until she FaceTimed me. She didn’t ask for permission to do that, so surely it should work both ways. I admit that my hair is very different now. I had quite fine, shoulder-length curls. Now I’ve cut it, I probably do look like an 80s PE teacher, as Becky says. But that’s just how it looks now. It will grow again, so who cares? Maybe Becky is more shallow than I thought. Maybe she only loves me for my hair Of course I care massively what Becky thinks, and I want to appear sexy and attractive to her. When she tells me that she doesn’t see me like that any more, it knocks my confidence and makes me worried for our relationship. I don’t feel good about this haircut now. But I can’t force her into liking it. If I want to look like a throwback porn star, so be it. Becky is a firm feminist and very opinionated. She always does what she wants, as she should, but I just find it a bit hypocritical. I always like how she looks, regardless of her hairstyle. Maybe she is more shallow than I thought, and maybe she only loves me for my hair. After eight years, I’m only just realising this. It’s like when your parents say, “If you get a tattoo, I’ll disown you.” It makes you feel like they will be disappointed with you. Becky goes through a rollercoaster of emotions with my new hair: anger, disgust, sadness, disappointment, acceptance. It’s like the five stages of grief for people whose boyfriends cut their hair. In all seriousness though, it doesn’t feel good that Becky’s love is conditional on how I present myself. It’s only hair, after all.",innocent,high
"Paul will relax for a bit if I force him to, but he can’t wait to rush out the door and do stuff Weekends are made for rest. It says so in the Bible. Our entire society is structured around a five-day working week. So I believe my irritation is justified when my boyfriend Paul wants to run around like a blue-arsed fly all Saturday and Sunday, and drag me along with him. He likes to optimise his weekend like he optimises the rest of his life – if he’s not learning something new or on the move, he feels like a failure. He works in finance and gets up early to get into the office, so at the weekend he finds it hard to switch off, whereas I am already in weekend mode by Friday morning. My ideal weekend involves lying in bed reading the papers for half the day, walking our dog to a market, then going back to bed to luxuriate before having a bath and a mooch about. Repeat on Sunday, but maybe add in dinner with friends. I call it “nesting”. But Paul wants to plan everything. If I force him to relax, he will for a bit, but then feels guilty and rushes out the door to the gym or to meet friends. My ideal weekend involves lying in bed and reading, walking our dog to a market, then going back to bed We have lived together for three years, and I’d noticed how organised everything in Paul’s life was before this. I am definitely more laid-back and I appreciate the fire he has. But after moving in together, I realised that Paul can’t just go with the flow, ever. I find this especially egregious at the weekend. I’ve now made him plan his downtime, because if we don’t add it to the Google calendar, he literally won’t relax. It’s funny, but it’s also annoying. When I want to just do nothing or change my plans at the last minute, he’ll say: “It’s not in the calendar.” One weekend we got into an argument because I didn’t want to get out of bed all Sunday. I’m a freelance architect and had endured a stressful project with a client so wanted to talk to no one. Paul said exercise and a pre-booked trip to this exhibition would pull me out of my slump, but I didn’t want to be told what to do. He ended up going out and leaving me all Sunday. I didn’t mind too much, but when he got back he was annoyed and I don’t think he had the right to be. Paul needs to learn how to sit with himself and not disturb me when I want to rest.","Amanda wants us to stay in pyjamas all weekend, but that is a complete waste of time in summer I don’t think I over-optimise my life, I just like to have a plan for things. I enjoy plotting out my weekends because my time is precious. I work long hours in the week and I need to know what I’m doing at the weekend because I don’t want to waste my free time. I don’t see any problem with putting everything into a Google calendar, including my downtime. It helps me relax if I know I’ve set time aside for it, and also helps me prioritise my time with Amanda. Amanda is the total opposite to me in that she doesn’t even want a schedule. She’s freelance and works very hard, so at the weekend she just wants to “nest” and then do something low-key, whereas I like to catch up on workouts at the gym and see what’s going on in our city or meet up with friends. I guess I’m generally more active than her, but I also just can’t laze around in bed all weekend – that is a complete waste of time. I really do think that getting out of bed can help when you’re feeling stressed I like some nesting. I’m not a monster. I like reading the paper in bed and cuddling up with Amanda for a couple of hours. But then I need to get up and do something else. Amanda often likes to stay in her pyjamas all weekend, except for the odd meal out, but in summer I find this really weird. Maybe a compromise would be to plan something chilled, but ahead of time. That way Amanda won’t feel rushed or pressured, but we could still do something together that I’ve put in the diary. Or we could schedule some downtime but with a strict cut-off point, after which we’d do something different, or split up for a bit. The time Amanda didn’t want to get out of bed was annoying because I’d got us tickets to a late museum night but she wanted to prioritise her “nesting.” I do respect her right to do what she wants, but I really do think that getting out of bed can help when you’re feeling stressed. Amanda could pick up the pace a bit at the weekends – I think it would be good for her and we’d probably have a better time together.",innocent,medium
"Our daughter is a year old. We can’t just give random people access to our private space Three months ago, my boyfriend Phil and I moved into a new flat with our baby daughter Marissa. It took us a while to get on the property ladder (we’re almost 40) – and the building is lovely. It’s an old Victorian property split into three flats. We’re on the ground floor with a private garden, accessible through our patio doors and an alleyway only we have the key for. Phil has made friends with everyone in the building already, which is very him, and he recently told me that some of the neighbours would like to use our garden. He said he’d been talking to our upstairs neighbour and she said that the last person who lived here, an elderly woman, was very happy during the summer to give people access by giving them keys to the gate in the alleyway. “Would you mind?” Phil asked me. The problem is: I do. Very much, in fact! The woman upstairs has two young sons and wants to be able to wander into my garden with them at her leisure? No thanks. The garden isn’t shared. I’m open to a potential barbecue, but I’m not giving away the keys to my hard-earned castle I said, “Look, can we settle in before we give other people access?” But he replied, “Oh, but it’s summer! We could be hosting everyone in the building.” I’m open to a potential barbecue, but I’m not giving away the keys to my hard-earned castle. The previous resident was probably lonely, but that’s not our situation. It’s presumptuous of this neighbour to ask and I think Phil should have put his foot down. I told him that he has to go back to our neighbour and tell her no. I’m not really a “mi casa es su casa” person and never have been. It’s an issue of privacy but also safety. Marissa is a year old. We can’t have random people around her. What happens if our neighbours give the key to someone else? Phil says that they would ask and not just wander in; that it’s more just allowing the kids to sunbathe when we’re out. But I don’t know if that’s the case. It would feel awkward if I wanted to use my garden and I had to ask people to leave. Phil is way too chummy with everyone, whereas I’m more cautious. I know he’s not looking forward to the conversation with this neighbour, but it might teach him to stop being so open.","The neighbours would only use the garden when we’re not home, so what’s the harm in sharing? Patricia is affronted that our neighbour dared ask to use our garden, and even more offended that I didn’t shut down her request right away. I don’t think any of this is a huge deal. Her reaction is quite funny. Obviously, our neighbour just wanted to see if things could continue as they had been doing before. I think Patricia dislikes the idea of people being in our garden at the same time as her, but we could stipulate that they can only use it when we’re out. I suggested this and she said she didn’t like the idea of people being so close to our house when we aren’t there. I think it’s important to get to know everyone in our building as we just moved in. Yes, this woman was a bit forward, but I didn’t say yes! By the way Patricia has reacted, you’d think that I’d already got alleyway gate keys cut and popped them through everyone’s letterboxes. You’d think that I’d already got alleyway gate keys cut and popped them through everyone’s letterboxes My way of thinking is: why shouldn’t we share the garden? If some kids in the building want to kick a football about, I don’t mind. I wouldn’t put Marissa at risk or let anyone come close to her, but our garden is about 50ft long, with lots of trees at the back. Even if two families were in it, we wouldn’t have to disturb each other and it’s not like we’d let just anyone have a key, these are our neighbours – they can become our friends. I’m not looking forward to breaking the news to the woman upstairs. I think it makes us look selfish. I always tease Patricia when she gets territorial over things and say it’s because she grew up as an only child. I grew up in a big family farmhouse so I’m used to the idea of communal living whereas Patricia is very “drawbridge up”. We’re fundamentally different in that sense, but I also understand that she’s a new mum (and a brilliant one) and she always wants to put Marissa first. She says she wants Marissa to roam freely around our house and garden, and I do understand that. I also think it could also be good for her to be socialised around other children, and a communal garden experience might help with that. Patricia is adamant though. Maybe I’ll raise the issue again when Marissa is a bit older, and we’ve lived in the flat for longer.",guilty,high
"I asked Leo to help me put on suncream. He did, but so half-heartedly I got burned I go to the beach only two or three times a year, as I burn easily and hate my phone and food getting dirty. But when a friend invited me and my boyfriend, Leo, to the seaside on a rare sunny day recently, I wore a long-sleeved shirt and thought it would be fun. After we arrived and Leo had put sunscreen on himself, I said: “I hate the stickiness on my hands. Can you put it on my legs, please?” But Leo told me I should do it myself and “get sticky”. I asked again and he eventually helped put sunscreen on half my legs really quickly. Later, I discovered that I was really burned, and had patches like a leopard. Leo was concerned, but I thought it was kind of his fault. But he said: “Are you serious? You’re not a child.” Leo said applying cream to my legs was ‘awkward’, but we’ve been together five years and live in a liberal country I hate the feeling of creams on my body. They sit on my skin and don’t really get absorbed. When my mum used to ask if I could help her rub cream in, I would never do it. Leo knows this. And he was covered in sunscreen, his hands were already sticky at the time, so what difference would it have made for him to help me? He also knows that I hate the beach and usually go just to be with him, so him helping would have been a small reward. Leo said applying cream to my legs was “awkward”, but we have been together for five years and live in a liberal country. I can’t understand why he wouldn’t help. Most people don’t think we are a couple. We don’t hold hands or show affection in public, but we’ve always been like that and it’s perfectly fine for me. It’s not as if I stood up and demanded help in front of everyone – we were sitting next to each other when I asked, and my knees were up and perfectly placed. But Leo gets a bit stuck in his ideas when he doesn’t want to do something. I’ll ask why and he just says, “No, because no.”","If you are a grownup and can reach an area, do it yourself. He wanted me to do his legs – that’s weird! When Filippo asked if I could put sunscreen on, I assumed he meant his back. But when he insisted on me doing his legs, I said, “Why do you need me to do that for you?” He said he didn’t want his hands to get sticky. But obviously no one likes getting their hands sticky. If you’re a grownup, you can reach the area of skin you want it on and are capable, you should do it yourself. It’s embarrassing otherwise. I think it’s weird to put sunscreen on someone else’s legs. He’s not a baby. Related: You be the judge: should my grown-up son help me move out of our house? Filippo said he was going to ask our friend to help on the beach, but I didn’t want to drag her into it. He was severely burned a few hours later and it looked really horrible. I told him it was ridiculous that he took a health risk because he didn’t want to get his hands sticky. He blamed me, but I’m not responsible for his wellbeing. I don’t have any internalised homophobia, I just really didn’t want to do it Filippo thinks I feel self-conscious on the beach, but it was very crowded and there was a high chance of people seeing me put sunscreen on his legs. I don’t have any internalised homophobia, I just really didn’t want to do it and was annoyed that he was pushing me. I didn’t deliberately do it badly in the hope he would burn. I just wanted to get it over with. If you don’t want to put sunscreen on, don’t go to the beach. Don’t complain if you’re not going to look after yourself. I do get that Filippo burns easily. He also can’t swim and goes to the beach mainly for me. So I guess my helping him would be a “small reward”, as he calls it. That makes sense. But in the past, he has refused to put sunscreen on because he wants to get the “first burn”, which he believes will fade to a tan. I think this is dangerous but he doesn’t listen. My only responsibility is to tell him to put on sunscreen, but I won’t force him. I’m not his parent. When he gets sunburnt, a little bit of me thinks that’s his punishment. Maybe it will help him learn.",innocent,medium
"He seems to resent me for asking him to help me sort out the house, but I don’t have anyone else to ask I’m selling my house, and my 30-year-old son Rupert is being very lax about it. He has lived at home with me for a few years – he moved back in after a breakup – but I get the impression he isn’t happy that his living situation is changing. He seems to resent me for asking him to help me sort out the house, but I don’t have anyone else to ask. When Rupert comes back from work, I’m usually deep in some project: throwing out old clothes, listing things on eBay. I’ll ask him for a hand but he will say, “Mum, I’ve been working all day, I can’t right now.” It’s always, “Not now, not now”. But I can’t do it all. I divorced a few years ago so don’t have a husband on hand to help out. Yes, I’m retired, but why should it be all up to me? I got a great offer on the house and want to move as quickly as possible so as not to mess the buyers about. I’ve been saying to Rupert for years that I would sell up as soon as it felt right, but I don’t think he really believed me. Well, now is the time. Rupert says: “When you pick a move-out date, I’ll help”. But I want him to pick up the pace now I need a hand sorting through all the things we no longer need. I’ve made a start and ordered a skip from the council that we can throw stuff in and then have it collected. But I haven’t received a move-out date from the buyers yet, so it’s hard to know how quickly I need to move. Rupert says: “When you pick a move-out date, I’ll help”. But I want him to pick up the pace now. He hasn’t really done much at all. I want him to put his items of furniture on Gumtree but he says it’s too early. It’s not like I will be kicking him out on his ear; I plan to give him some cash to help with renting as I know that it’s tricky for young people these days. We have lived in this house since he was born, so it’s Rupert’s house, too. There are lots of memories here and it does feel a bit emotional. But I’m moving abroad with my partner and I’m looking forward to it. I just wish the process of moving out was more of a shared effort and Rupert was on board with the reality of it.","Mum hasn’t picked a move-out date so it’s impossible to know how urgent we need to be It’s not that I haven’t accepted the house sale, or that I’m disengaged. I’m just busy. I work every day doing long shifts and the last thing I want to do when I get home is start packing up my room. Mum will call me over as soon as I walk through the door and I just think: can you not? I am usually knackered and just want to sleep. The main issue is that Mum hasn’t picked a move-out date, so it’s impossible to know how urgent we need to be with timings. She wants me to sell all my bedroom furniture now. Fine. But then what am I going to sleep on after it’s sold? The floor? Putting things online isn’t too much to ask, but she hasn’t thought things through. When I get home from work, being bombarded with tasks is the last thing I want She will just randomly think of a task without weighing it up. There’s no organisation. Mum’s always been a bit slapdash, whereas I’m thinking: is it urgent? What order shall we do it in? My medical training has made me a bit of a logical thinker and my father is like that, too. I’ve told Mum we need to sit down and make a list of what needs to be done and when, because right now it all feels random. When I get home from work, being bombarded with tasks that she suddenly thinks need to be done right now is the last thing I want. I’ve already helped Mum sort through our bookshelves and throw out lots of old clothes, but there’s so much more to do. I just can’t do it on Mum’s timeline, especially as we don’t know when we’re actually moving out. The sale of the house is sad and emotional for me too, of course. I moved back home a year ago after a breakup and now I need to find somewhere else to live. It’s a lot of moving. I guess it’s probably for the best, because living at home after hitting 30 isn’t cute. I’m grateful for Mum’s offer to help out with rent, but navigating the rental market will be hard on just a doctor’s salary. In the meantime, I’d be happy to help Mum sort through the house if we could just organise our tasks.",guilty,high
"She doesn’t do it in our private bathroom – because other people won’t see it there – but she will everywhere else My wife, Marian, has a funny habit and I think it’s all to do with trying to keep up appearances. She’s always filling up expensive bottles of things with stuff from a cheaper brand. She’s done it for years. It’s usually with the bottles of hand soaps in our downstairs bathroom, but she’s also done it with diffusers and shampoos. I’m always teasing her and saying “this isn’t the real thing, is it?” But one time I did it in front of her sister and Marian got really annoyed. She said I’d shown her up, but I just think it’s amusing. For years now Marian has been filling up luxury hand soap bottles with soap we buy at Lidl. What’s funny is that she doesn’t do it in our private bathroom – because other people won’t see it there – but she will everywhere else. The expensive bottles are starting to wear a bit now, but she won’t throw them out because they’ve got a prestigious label on them. Marian also does it with diffusers. She loves Jo Malone diffuser sets and bought a few for our house years ago. But when they started to lose their smell, she filled up the bottles with diffusers from Aldi. It is quite genius to be fair, and I did approve at first because I thought the originals were far too costly. The expensive bottles are starting to wear, but she won’t throw them out because they’ve got a prestigious label on them But I don’t like what it represents. I grew up on a farm in rural England, in a family of eight, and we were a very “what you see is what you get” family. My dad was a bit rough around the edges and my brothers and sisters don’t have any airs and graces about them. If I mentioned to them that Marian is so bothered about what people think of her that she’s keeping branded bottles around our house to make herself look posh, they’d all rip the piss out of her. But I can’t do that because Marian is embarrassed by it. We’ve been married 15 years and she’s always been quite glam, but I do think this is ridiculous. If you’re going to be cheap, just own it, that’s what I say. Ironically, it’s the well off, middle classes who seem most preoccupied with looking as if they’ve got more than they do.","I just think: do you want nice interiors on a budget price, or not? Like many women, I am responsible for making sure our shared house is not a stinky man cave, so of course I buy things like diffusers and nice soaps. Ted likes these, but gets shocked about how much they actually cost. So once they’ve run out, I don’t always fill them up with the original brand. This has been at his encouragement, but then he tells me that I’m obsessed with class and money for doing so. I just think: do you want nice interiors on a budget price, or not? Aldi does a great range of refills which smell like the originals, but I also don’t want to throw away my expensive Jo Malone bottle and replace it with something that is obviously not designer. It makes far more sense to keep the nice bottle – I reject the idea that this means I’m obsessed with “keeping up appearances”. It’s just common sense. I’m trying to create an aesthetic – if anything, it’s an act of generosity It’s the same with the soaps. I guess because I only do this in our guest bathroom, it’s a little harder to defend. I like the idea of making my guests feel special, and part of that involves having fancier products on display for them to use. I know they aren’t actually using them, it’s just the idea of the thing – I’m trying to create an aesthetic. If anything, it’s an act of generosity. I’m letting people think they are stepping into a house of luxury even if they are really using the cheap stuff. Related: You be the judge: my parents want to donate their old furniture to us – should my partner accept it? Ted grew up in a working-class household in Yorkshire, whereas my parents were “city folk”, as he calls them. My mum was a lawyer before she retired and my dad worked in insurance. I think they cared a lot about what people thought of them. We always rolled out the good biscuits and the best china when guests came over, and my dad took great pride in making sure our garden was the best-kept on our street. I’ve retained that house pride, but times are tough so I am trying to do it on a budget. Ted should be grateful he’s got such a savvy wife and not out me in front of people like my sister when they visit. I’ll continue to do this as long as I like.",innocent,medium
"Just because I’m the eldest doesn’t mean I should always be the one to send them gifts and cards I love my grandparents on my mum’s side – they’re the only ones we have left – but as the oldest sibling, it feels like it’s always my job to keep up the relationship on behalf of me and my brother. I’ve been doing it for years, but I’m 28 now, and tired of it. My younger brother, Babatunde, makes me do all the general relationship admin, like texting them at Christmas, thanking them for our gifts, and sending cards for their birthdays. Our grandparents are great but they don’t live near us. They have certain expectations around staying in touch, and Babatunde can’t be bothered to meet them. They don’t know that it’s always me sending them thank you notes and cards. Babatunde is their youngest grandson so he gets away with doing the bare minimum. Mum spoils him as he’s her only son. I’m the eldest daughter, and it feels like I always have to be more responsible. Last Christmas I did lose it with Babatunde. As a gift, our grandparents sent us money straight to our accounts, and Babatunde didn’t even notice the transfer. Our grandparents called me a few weeks later to complain that he hadn’t thanked them at all. My grandpa was like: “What is the point in giving him money?” I had to apologise on his behalf and tell them that he doesn’t check his bank account regularly. It was embarrassing. Our grandparents are in their 90s now, and it’s important to stay in their lives I sent a thank you text on the same day, and was in the process of organising a visit to them, too. Of course, Babatunde wasn’t available to join me. He’s only a year younger than me but sometimes I feel like I’m his keeper. When he realised our grandparents were mad at him, he was really apologetic, but asked me not to tell our mum. Obviously I obliged, but I did tell him to call our grandparents on the phone and say sorry. But he didn’t even have their number, and when I gave it to him, he just sent a text instead of calling them. I think Babatunde needs to make more effort. They’re in their 90s now, and it’s important to stay in their lives. I’m also going to stop covering for him because I’ve got my own life to lead.","I’m the baby of the family – that’s just how it is I definitely know that I should make more effort with our grandparents and I do want to try to be better. With the money thing, it wasn’t that deep. I just don’t check my accounts like that. It’s not like they gave us thousands of pounds: it was £200. I don’t mean to sound ungrateful but it didn’t register because it wasn’t a life-changing sum. Lolly (Ololade) had to call them up and apologise on my behalf because I didn’t thank them. I feel a bit ashamed of that, but it honestly wasn’t intentional. She told me to contact them to rectify the situation and I did, but then she got mad at me because I didn’t call. But what can I say? I’m not the most communicative guy. Lolly is the chatty one in our family. She’s always been better at staying in contact, filling our extended family in on what’s going on. She gets the gossip from our cousins and makes an effort with everyone. It’s what she’s good at. Lolly threatened to tell my mum about how bad I’ve been, but I’ve covered for her loads of times I do appreciate that she sends the thank you cards to our grandparents at Christmas and on their birthdays. She’s playing her role as the dutiful granddaughter. But in making us both look good, she’s making our family look good, too, so her actions benefit us all. Lolly has left out that I have sent my grandparents cards in the past – probably about three times, maybe four. She says I get away with everything because I’m the baby of the family. That’s just how it is. My grandmother spoils me and I think it annoys Lolly that she always has to feed information to them about me. I do text them, but for sure I could be better at it. Or pick up the phone, or even organise a visit. The last time I saw them was when my mum made us all visit last Christmas, but Lolly sees them more often. Lolly threatened to tell my mum about how bad I’ve been recently. That would have contravened our unspoken sibling agreement not to snitch. I’ve covered for her loads of times before: she snuck her boyfriend into her room when she was 24, for one. Our mum would have hit the roof. But there are just certain things you don’t tell.",guilty,high
"I passed my test 14 years ago, but haven’t driven much since – and only ever an automatic Both my husband, Johnny, and I can drive manual cars, but we disagree over whether we should get a manual or an automatic for our first family car. We have a nine-month-old baby, Rowena, and after years of not owning a car we have decided that we can no longer go without one. I feel strongly that we should buy an automatic, whereas Johnny thinks a manual would be better. His main argument is that it’s far cheaper to buy a manual. Since we have just had a baby, money is tight. Looking at prices, there is a big difference (it’s about £3,000 between a manual and the automatic car I would like) so I don’t disagree with him there. But I’m a new mum and value comfort and ease. It’s also a question of confidence. I am with Rowena at home most of the time, but when I do want to drive, I don’t want to feel like I’m trapped because I’m scared of my car. I passed my test 14 years ago, when I was 18, and since then I have only driven on and off, and always in an automatic, except once with a friend’s car on a weekend away. I hated all the constant gear switching, and I don’t want to go back to that. Johnny says driving a manual is “like riding a bike – you don’t forget”, but I think I have forgotten. I would have to have lessons again and that would also be a waste of money. We live in a big city. If we had an automatic, I would feel more relaxed as I wouldn’t have the stress of constant gear shifting in slow traffic. Our baby will often be in the car and I believe my sense of wellbeing and her safety to be the most important factors Besides, our baby will often be in the car. I believe my sense of wellbeing and her safety are paramount, so if I’m not comfortable getting into a manual, I don’t think I should be forced to do so just to save a few grand. Though we would be sharing the car, Johnny would be driving it more: he will use it every day to commute, so he thinks he should have a bigger say. But my opinion counts as it’s still a shared car. We share chores pretty well, but if I don’t like the car, it will put the burden of driving on Johnny. If he’s happy with that, then fine, but I know after a while it will grate on him.","A manual car will cost us thousands less – and they are easier and cheaper to maintain, too Most people in the UK drive a manual transmission car, so if we get one, we won’t be in the minority. Julia thinks it’s less modern to own a manual but that’s not true. We don’t live in the US or Australia, where manual cars are not that common. It’s still really normal here. Manual cars are easier to come by in the secondhand car world, too – it seems like there’s always a good deal to be had. And now we have Rowena, I’m keen to save money where we can. The make of car we want will cost us thousands less in a manual than the automatic. Manual cars are also generally less maintenance than automatics, and you have greater control when you’re driving. In my mind, you’re not a ‘real’ driver unless you can master a manual as well as an automatic I think it makes for a better driving experience. In my mind, you’re not a “real” driver unless you can master a manual as well as an automatic. I know that’s not strictly true but it’s what my dad taught me when I was learning to drive, and it’s just how I feel. Maybe it’s a man thing. I passed my test when I was 18, the same age as Julia, but as I have been driving non-stop since then, I don’t really feel a lack of confidence. Julia is a very good driver and she wouldn’t need more lessons, but I would be happy to take her out and refresh her skills before she hops in the driving seat. I think she is panicking because her driving is a bit rusty, but that is an easy fix. It’s not the end of the world if we have to get her a few lessons, and that would still be much cheaper than getting an automatic. Also, because I’m the one who will be driving it every day, Julia doesn’t need to panic about it yet. Yes, we would both have access to the car, but she wouldn’t drive it much as she’s still on maternity leave and would just use it at weekends and in the evenings. I would take her out, with Rowena, and build up her confidence when she’s driving. Overall we would save thousands of pounds and it would be largely my car, so it just makes more sense to have a manual. To me it’s a no-brainer.",guilty,medium
"Barry is very leftwing and wants to change my views. But I have a right to keep my thoughts to myself My husband, Barry, has strong political opinions and is very leftwing. He’s always trying to persuade me to change my views, and I don’t like it. I was brought up in a very conservative family – it’s all I knew. I don’t like being told what to think, so I try to vote in secret, which he hates. Recently, when it came to the mayoral elections in London, he got very wound up because I wouldn’t tell him who I was voting for. The postal-vote slip was in the kitchen and he kept saying: “Have you filled that out yet?” I planned to vote at the last minute, but I wouldn’t tell him who for. He’d say: “Do you want me to fill in your postal vote for you?”, which is actually fraud. I think he was joking, but he was desperate to control my vote. We met back in 2010 and didn’t speak about politics as much then, but now it’s an issue If I say anything positive about the Conservative party in our house, it triggers Barry. He completely loses it. One time he said: “If you vote Conservative in the next election, I’ll divorce you.” And I think he meant it. Our middle daughter has picked up on the tension and tells me not to tell him who I’m voting for, so as to prevent an argument. Every time something happens in the news or with the NHS, Barry says: “Well, you voted for this party.” We met in 2010, and I don’t remember him being like this at the time. We didn’t speak about politics as much then, but now it’s an issue, as Barry is so passionate. Whenever I try to say something, he knocks me down because he knows more about politics than me. It was like that with my dad, who was obsessed with politics and a Tory all his life. But I feel apathetic about voting and that it’s a waste of time. I’ve got enough to worry about, and I think that I can’t control politics in this country. I do always vote though. I don’t think the Conservatives have done a good job, and Barry and I actually agree on some things: we both voted to stay in the EU and think doctors are overworked. I kind of want Labour to get in to shut him up. But I don’t think we should discuss politics, as he gets so worked up about it. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes","I have become so angry with this government, and I want to be able discuss it with Mandy Mandy wouldn’t tell me who she was voting for in the local elections last month, so I thought, “Right, I’ll have to find out.” I know I go on and on about politics, but I grew up in a politically aware household where we talked politics all the time. I think families should have these discussions. Mandy’s dad, for example, was quite far right and voted for Brexit, but always had an informed response and was very knowledgable and we often discussed our views. But Mandy doesn’t want to tell me anything. We met in 2010, just before the coalition election, and I remember that she voted for David Cameron. We were in a new relationship then, and I didn’t debate politics with her. But, like many people, I’ve grown angrier in the past few years. Watching things go wrong with the Tories during the pandemic wound me up more than ever. It’s been such a long time since we had a Labour government, so I’m frustrated. Perhaps our views feel more polarising this time around. We do agree on some things: the NHS, education, private schools. But these days I’m more anti-Tory than pro-Labour, although I voted for Sadiq Khan for London mayor. I always vote Labour. Mandy and I can talk through disagreements, but I could probably be better at listening and not shouting her down. I stand by my view that people in close relationships should discuss their political leanings with each other When Mandy defends the Tories, I always say: “Fourteen years, and look what they’ve done to this country!” I feel we’re all exhausted with how the Conservatives have run the UK. At the local elections Mandy wouldn’t give me an indication of which way she was voting, and it drove me mad. I wasn’t really going to fill in her postal vote for her – that was a joke. And so was the time I said I would divorce her if she voted Tory. Mandy says she won’t be sharing her voting preferences with me in the upcoming general election, and I guess I will have to deal with that. But I stand by my view that people in close relationships should discuss their political leanings. It’s healthy.",guilty,medium
"Everyone make mistakes – even Mum – and she knows I can’t afford my own car and road tax My mum, Jane, has become really protective over her new car. I am 21 and live at home, and she used to put me on her insurance so I could drive her car, too. I don’t really drive much, it’s just for getting around, and I always pay for the petrol I use. And of course, Mum always has priority when it comes to using it. But I recently dented her old car, just before she sold it, and now Mum has revoked all driving privileges, which I think is really unfair. I have been driving for a couple of years now and never had any problems with road safety, but when I was parallel parking a few months ago I accidentally reversed into a tree and put a big dent in the rear of the car. Mum said she had to take a hit to the price when she sold it because of that dent. She was really annoyed, even though I offered to pay for it. She said it was time I got my own car. I protested to my dad (who has his own car for work) but he didn’t want to get involved and said I couldn’t be insured on his as it’s even more valuable. I have been driving for a couple of years and never had much of an issue with safety I feel as if I’m being punished for something that happens to lots of people. My parents are making out that I’m a bad driver, but before the accident they said I was great. And doesn’t everyone make mistakes? I remember Mum telling me she crashed her first car when she was 18, so she’s not perfect. I don’t have the money to buy a car, let alone pay for road tax and insurance on top, and my parents know this. Mum says that a car isn’t a necessity for me, and for now I should focus on working to save up for one. We live in London, so having a car isn’t essential. I get the train to work, but I’ve got used to being able to drive at weekends and in my spare time, and now I feel like that has been snatched away. My mum’s new car isn’t that fancy so I don’t know why she doesn’t just put me on the insurance. I have offered to contribute towards the road tax, too.","The dent proved that Abbie has some growing up to do. She should save up for her own car Abbie is responsible enough, but can be careless at times. She doesn’t know the value of things yet and doesn’t always take as much care of things as she should. I had her insured on my old car for about a year and it was fine for a while, but then she reversed into something and wiped £500 off the value when it was time to sell. I had said to her: “Be careful when you go out, because I’m selling the car soon.” And what did she do? Crashed it. It was very inconvenient. Yes, that was the only incident, but it proved that Abbie still has some growing up to do. I think it would be best if she bought her own car instead of borrowing mine and asking to be added to my insurance all the time. We live in London, a car isn’t necessary. She’s in a privileged position to save as she’s living at home rent-free My new car is quite nice and I don’t want to take the risk of Abbie reversing into another tree. She can afford to save up for her own as she’s living at home rent-free. I also think she should pay for some refresher driving lessons after her little incident. We live in London, so if she doesn’t save up for her own then that’s fine too, as a car isn’t really necessary in such a big city. She can take the train or bus, and also ask for a lift from me or her dad. When I told Abbie she wouldn’t be driving my new car, she kicked off and tried to rope her dad in to defend her – but he agreed with me. He said saving up for her own car would teach her some responsibility and she should wait until she can afford one. Abbie said that everyone has road accidents, but that’s not true. She brought up the time I crashed my first car when I was 18, but my motto is always “do as I say and not as I do”, so I don’t think it’s relevant. I was quite annoyed that my old car was dented but I’m over it now. I’m not punishing Abbie like she thinks, but she’s in a very privileged position as she lives at home. Now is the time to encourage her to be more responsible and save up for her own car – if she really wants one.",innocent,medium
"I’m happy that Rob will get a hand, but it’s a lot more than I had from Mum, which I don’t think is fair I’m 36 and I got on the property ladder by myself when I was 31. I scrimped and saved but was also on a very good wage in my job as a marketing executive. My mum, Patricia, also gave me a bit of help: £10,000 to be exact, for which I was very grateful. I also used the government lifetime ISA scheme, which I saw as a great way to get free money. I had to remortgage recently when the rates were sky high (my mortgage went up by £200 a month), and have struggled a bit as I’m single, though I can get by. I have since learned that Mum is planning to sell our family home that I haven’t lived in for years. She wants to give me and my brother, Rob, money, but says the priority is to help out Rob. She wants to downsize and buy him a flat outright as well as a property for herself. She pointed out the stamp duty discounts for those buying multiple properties at once as a good reason. I’m happy that Rob will get a hand, but it’s a lot more than I had from Mum, which I don’t think is fair. I suggested Rob can rent until he earns more, like I did Rob, who is 28, can see that I’m lumbered with a big mortgage and have had to make all the payments on my own for years. He lives at home with Mum, who feels guilty for turfing him out. No one bought a flat for me. She has now suggested she could buy Rob the flat, but that he would pay half of my mortgage while I had one, so he wouldn’t be totally bill-free and it would be fairer to me. I wasn’t opposed to this, but I think it’s really complicated. Does that mean Rob has a legal stake in my property? What if something happens and suddenly Rob has more expenses and won’t be able to afford to help me? I’d rather keep things separate. The other alternative is that Mum just gives us equal amounts of cash, with me receiving £10,000 less than Rob. I think this is the fairest way to give us a gift, but Mum is worried Rob won’t be able to buy a property for several more years as he doesn’t have a good salary. I suggested he can rent until he earns more, like I did. It’s all complex but maybe I should stay out of it. Am I being selfish for even pointing out the unfairness of the original proposition? It would entrench inequality in our family and I don’t think Mum has thought it through. Rob is pretty neutral. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes","Rob obviously needs more help than Martin, and I’d like to see him sorted My thinking behind buying a flat for Rob was that he needs somewhere to live now that I’m selling the house. I just feel that renting is such dead money. Martin rented for a bit before I helped him buy his place, but renting was cheaper then. I will sell my house for a good amount (around £750,000) and it’s mortgage-free, so I want to help out. My husband left years ago and I paid off the mortgage by myself. Now I want to retire by the sea. But before I go, I want to give my kids a gift. Rob obviously needs more help than Martin, and I’d like to see him sorted. I realise that Rob living mortgage-free isn’t fair, but I would give Martin some cash too. He’s not happy with that because he says Rob will be catapulted ahead of him financially. I guess the issue is that he would be paying off his mortgage for years whereas Rob would be living with no bills. To appease him I suggested Rob help Martin pay off his mortgage. Martin thinks this will complicate matters, and could compromise their relationship should anything go wrong. I don’t want to do either of my kids wrong and I don’t want Martin to think that Rob is the favourite son Martin says gifting us equal amounts of cash is the fairest way, but that won’t help Rob. He can’t buy a property on his own as his salary is too low. Really, Martin and his brother are lucky to have any help at all. Lots of their friends don’t get anything from their parents. I suppose the fairest way is for Rob to rent for a bit as Martin did, and for me to give them the same amount. I don’t want to do either of my kids wrong and I don’t want Martin to think that Rob is the favourite son. I would like to retire and feel I’ve done my best for both my children.",guilty,medium
"“It’s like I’m the sole carer on a personal and emotional level, as well as financial I recently had a baby with my long-term partner, Mikey. We have been together for five years and our relationship – save for the odd disagreement about the washing or his pants on the floor – is generally harmonious. Our baby, Kitty, is a year old and I am planning to go back to work part-time in three months, while juggling nursery and childcare. That’s something we agreed and I’m happy with it because I need to work to feel alive. The childcare costs were covered 50-50 by our salaries, but recently I’ve been using my maternity pay to cover all other things baby-related. It just started off that way as I was ordering the baby stuff, as I knew what to get. To make things easier, though, I now feel it’s time for a joint account. Mikey earns three times more than me (£130,000), but we have never paid into one account. I don’t think we’ve needed to until now because Mikey has always covered most of our rent and, more recently, our mortgage. (He pays two-thirds of our £2,000 mortgage and I cover the rest). He’s generous in other areas and pays for food, our date nights and our flights when we travel. I cover some of the household bills as I run the house, and have covered everything for Kitty. It’s as if he’s paying me to look after his child and I’d rather make a joint account – that’s what my parents did However, the time has come when I think he needs to get involved with childcare costs fully. It just feels as if he’s not really tuned in to the reality of raising Kitty. It’s like I’m the sole carer on a personal and emotional, as well as financial, level. Things are more expensive than he realises and my maternity pay has been spent on this. With me going back to work I’ll be earning more, but the childcare costs will eat into that difference. I’m aware that Mikey is looking after us in other ways, but I don’t want to feel as if Kitty is all on me. I’m fairly good with money, I don’t have expensive habits, so Mikey needs to stop holding back and open an account for us both. Mikey has always said he would when we get married, but that’s a while away. We probably won’t tie the knot until 2026. I won’t be waiting until then. Merging finances just makes sense. I would like him to either open an account that we pay everything we earn into or we make a third account and pay in a set amount from our wages, and I take from that when I need something for Kitty. Mikey should pay more into it than me though, as his salary is larger. He’s not opposed to it, but he’s been dragging his heels and says he would rather give me an allowance or a top-up into my personal account each month. I don’t like how that feels: it’s as if he’s paying me to look after his child. I would rather have a joint account – that’s what my parents did. Maybe it just shows our differing attitudes to money, but I don’t get why he’s acting so strangely. What difference does a joint account make when we have a baby and a mortgage? Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes","The thought of relinquishing all control to her when it comes to my earnings doesn’t come naturally to me The way Jana talks sometimes you’d think I don’t trust her. She’s my fiancee and the mother to my child, and I want to spend the rest of my life with her, so I definitely don’t want to see her struggle. I pay most of our mortgage and bills because I earn more, and I’m happy to do it. That makes perfect sense to me and, since she’s just had Kitty, I’ll support her in whatever way possible. She’s a great mother and – seeing how much domestic work she does every day while I’m in my office – I’ve gained a newfound respect for her as a partner and a mother. When it comes to paying all our money into one shared account, though, I’ve got a mental block. I’ve never done that with anyone before – but I’ve never been in a relationship this serious. The thought of relinquishing control to her when it comes to my earnings doesn’t come naturally to me. I wouldn’t say I’m selfish, but I am a control freak. I saw my parents fighting about money a lot growing up and I never want that to be us Jana thinks it’s the natural step if we’re going to be raising Kitty and she’s going to be arranging the childcare and nursery fees, but I’m struggling with it for some reason. I saw my parents fighting about money a lot growing up and I never want that to be us. I don’t want to see what Jana spends or have to ask her about certain transactions. I like the way it is now because I cover most things and she picks up a few extra bills and covers Kitty’s things. Our personal expenditures are then our own. Neither of us has crazy habits, but I like that separation. I think it’s healthy. I’d rather pay more into Jana’s account or give her an allowance for Kitty, but she says that makes her feel like I’m paying her to look after our baby. I don’t know what she means: I’m well aware that I’m a father and I’m hands-on. Jana says I don’t know how much all the childcare costs as she’s used her maternity pay. I suppose we could tally it all up but I’m happy to pay whatever I need; I just don’t feel the need to merge our accounts. Maybe when we get married, but also maybe not.",guilty,medium
"Confronting Tom’s toxic attitudes is good practice for my sister and will boost her confidence My younger sister, Layla, never gets involved in discussions between me and our brother, Tom, and I worry about the impact he has on her. I moved out years ago, but Layla and Tom still live with our parents. Whenever I visit them, I have to listen to Tom spouting crap. Everyone else seems immune to it. Layla often won’t back me up when I correct him. Maybe she thinks that, as the eldest, I’ve got it covered – but she needs to learn how to stick up for herself, especially when she doesn’t agree with him. Tom’s views are getting worse with age. He’s 28 and Layla is 23. I get into shouting matches with him because, in my opinion, he’s a bigot. He has awful opinions about women and their role in society. He’s also a bit of a conspiracy theorist and had some worrying views on Covid that I had to correct. If it weren’t for me, I don’t think he would have got vaccinated. My parents and Layla didn’t want to get involved, which annoyed me. Maybe she thinks that, as the eldest, I’ve got it covered, but Layla needs to learn how to stick up for herself We’re a big football family, but Tom has a problem with female commentators and the women’s game. He says they don’t play properly and that the reason they have jobs is because of a “woke agenda”. I tell him that woke isn’t even an insult, but he doesn’t get it. He works only with men in a trade job and gets a lot of his news off Facebook. When Layla witnesses these rows, I say: “Back me up, Layla” and usually she will just say: “I’m staying out of it.” But I know she doesn’t like listening to Tom either. One time when Tom was going on about how women have it easier at work than men, Layla snapped and told him he was talking rubbish. Tom laughed, as he loves to get a reaction. I was happy to see Layla assert herself in that instance, but usually she just walks out of the room or lets me carry the mantle. I think it’s important that Layla stands up for herself and things she believes in. I don’t think she needs to be debating our brother all the time – but correcting his views is good practice for other situations in life, and I want to see her grow in confidence.","Mina wants to make a stand, but after a row, it’s me who has to deal with the aftershocks at home Mina is really opinionated, and Tom is, too. A lot of his views are problematic, and I know that. It’s just that I can’t be bothered to be the one who has to tell him why he’s wrong. Mina also forgets that I’m the one who has to live at home with him. She gets to dip in and out of these debates, but I have to live with him 24/7, so I tend to pick my battles. When I’m pushed to the brink I will always get involved, but obviously it takes a lot of energy, so I don’t make a habit of it. I’m also not as outspoken as my older siblings in general, and I try to tell Mina that, but she tries to rile me. She will say: “What do you think, Layla? Speak up.” It’s actually quite annoying. I think: “Leave me alone.” I don’t like getting involved in petty rows with my siblings, and whenever Mina and Tom get together it blows up When Mina came around for Sunday lunch the other week, Tom was going off about female pundits and the “woke agenda” – and I did speak up. I told Tom he sounded like an incel . He hates that word, and it really triggers him, but I stood by it and we got into a heated argument that our parents had to put a stop to. Mina was stirring the pot a bit, though, and said things like: “See, Layla agrees with me.” It can make things worse. I know she wants to stand up for what’s right, but while Mina can go back to her flat after an argument, I have to deal with the aftershocks in our home, and it can take everyone time to calm down. Tom and I have a separate relationship outside Mina, and I’d like to preserve that. When we aren’t debating things, we get on fairly well. He helps me out with fixing things, and sometimes he asks me for advice on women, funnily enough. We also go to football matches together, and Mina doesn’t see any of that. She says he’s getting worse with his views, but I think there’s a different way to get through to him which is less abrasive. Mina needs to chill out a bit and understand that Tom and I have a different dynamic. I speak up as and when I need to.",innocent,high
"My stomach just can’t handle this much chilli. Jamal even puts it in spaghetti bolognese! My housemate Jamal and I take it in turns to cook each week, but when it’s his week he makes food that’s way too spicy for me. He says I should just “man up” and upgrade my palate, but it’s not that easy. I’m from a British/Irish background and he has Jamaican and Nigerian heritage, so he grew up on a spicier diet. Whenever Jamal cooks, he does a spicy curry or really well-seasoned chicken, and my digestive system just can’t handle it. I love the flavours, but I nearly always pay for it the next day. After I ate his jerk chicken, which he made extra spicy, my stomach was in bits the next day. Jamal says my food is unseasoned (which I disagree with), so that if I make him compromise when it’s his turn to cook, he will end up suffering twice, because he’ll have to eat boring food two weeks in a row. He says I should just “man up” and upgrade my palate, but it’s not that easy I think he’s just joking about my cooking. I rate myself as a cook as highly as I rate him – I just don’t use as much spice. Jamal puts scotch bonnet chillies and cayenne pepper in everything – and it’s too much. The dishes I’m drawn to don’t naturally lend themselves to spice. I make a great lasagne, and brilliant chicken tikka curry. I do like Jamal’s beef suya, which is like a spiced kebab, and his pepper soup, but only when he makes them extra mild. We’ve been cooking for each other for about six months. Jamal says I shouldn’t complain, because the original rule – whoever is cooking can make what they want – was my idea. We compromise a little because Jamal doesn’t eat pork, so I wouldn’t cook that for him, but the rule was introduced so we didn’t squabble about what to make. I really like it that we cook for each other, because we’re busy boys. It’s nice coming home to dinner made for me every other week. He doesn’t have to take all the spices away but maybe he could lay off the chilli. He even puts it in spaghetti bolognese! If I’m prepared to leave out pork, he should tone down the spices.","I grew up eating food with lots of flavour. Jason should learn to embrace world cuisines When you ask someone to season their food less, you are asking them to leave out a part of who they are. Jason is asking me to give up my history and my heritage. He’s asking me to give away a piece of my soul. It is unnatural for me to eat unseasoned food. He’s used to eating food that’s only been seasoned with a dash of salt and pepper. But I’m not about that life. I grew up eating curries and stews that have loads of flavour and chilli, so I naturally add that to my cooking. Jason is lucky he gets to sample world cuisines. I don’t make a lot of Nigerian dishes for him because I don’t think he could hack them, but he does like my suya, and the jollof I cook, as they are less spicy. Jason introduced this rule: whoever cooks doesn’t have to consult with the other person I also regularly make jerk chicken, and used to add lots of scotch bonnet to the marinade, but when I’m cooking for him, I feel pressure to tone it down, which I don’t really like. I enjoy food that has a bit of a kick to it, but when I make it the way I want it to taste, Jason complains. He says he can’t eat the dinners, and that he’s on the loo a lot the next day. Obviously I empathise and try to tone it down, but even when I think I have, he’ll still say the spices are too much. It’s got to the point where I need to have him besides me while I cook, testing the sauces as I’m making them. Jason introduced this rule: whoever cooks doesn’t have to consult with the other person. But now he’s begging to know exactly how much pepper I’m adding to everything. That makes me laugh. I’m happy to compromise, but it has to work both ways. I don’t particularly want to eat a plain jacket potato or a bland chicken tikka masala curry when it’s his turn to be chef, but I do. We should probably devise a menu together and then each week go off and cook it. But the main issue lies in the ingredients we use to cook the meals, and I don’t know if I can be bothered to test his food as he cooks, or have him test mine. I reckon Jason just needs to adjust his palate and enjoy the spice of life.",guilty,medium
"I want us to unwind together but Tara always has to work late because she naps all day My girlfriend Tara is the queen of naps. I’m not opposed to them in theory – short naps are good for the brain – but when I come home from work and Tara is in bed, I find it a little weird. No adult needs to nap as much as Tara does. She naps every day, and I think it’s a symptom of her generally bad working habits and the fact she’s always at home (her bedtime routine has always been worse than mine, too). We’re night owls, but Tara more so than me. She’s a freelance writer who also works in music production, and she uses the night to write and play new music. I usually wind down in our bedroom with a film or a book until 11pm, but Tara sometimes stays up until 2am. The following morning, I will get up and get ready for work, but Tara will stay in bed unless I wake her. She usually gets up after I’ve left (I’m not sure when) and then gets on with her day, but will often have a power nap at 3 or 4pm. The naps last for about two hours, or so she says. It means she’s got all this energy left later in the evening She says she doesn’t nap every day but I’ve come home several times to find her asleep in bed. Sometimes I’ll say: “Wake up! It’s not even 7pm!” But usually I just let her sleep. She’ll then get up when I’m making dinner and start working, which might carry on through the night. I’d prefer it if she worked more in the day and did less at night. I want to chat and unwind together in the evenings, but Tara will be working for ages. I think her naps are the main reason for this. They last for about two hours, or so she says, and it means she’s still got all this energy left later in the evening. But I also think she needs to change her overall routine and try to get up when I go to work. The naps are only necessary because her whole bedtime routine is out of whack. I do tell her this but Tara says: “I’ve been like this for years: it’s hard to get out of it.” She says she’s hard-wired this way, that she’s neurodivergent (she’s not), and that I’m forcing her to change her natural rhythm. But she just needs to go to bed at a normal hour.","I get a second wind after a nap, and my creative flow is better. That’s why I like to work at night I love my naps and always have. I like to work in the evening because I’m a bit of a night owl. I don’t know if the two things are correlated: am I a night owl because I nap, or is it the other way around? As I’m self-employed and work from home, I have the privilege of being able to nap whenever I want. But Tobias says that by napping, I’m ruining my schedule as I have too much energy in the evening. I obviously disagree. After I nap during the day, I feel better than ever and get a second wind, so that’s why I want to work into the night. Tobias hates it when I work after dinner but it’s just what I like doing. I feel I’m more at peace at night, and can take in more information as my brain is calmer. I do have to do some work in the morning, too, because that’s required from some of my clients, but then at night I do my clear-headed thinking – I listen to music, make notes and write. My creative flow is better in the evening. It’s like my brain needs to warm up before I can complete my best work. I think Tobias resents me resting when he comes home from work, which he could probably do with analysing in therapy Tobias has only come home and found me in bed a few times. I don’t nap for hours every day; sometimes it’s just for 30 minutes. Other times, I’ll probably sleep for two hours max. He talks as if I’m lounging around all day but it’s just not true. One time he woke me with a really loud bang, which I didn’t appreciate. I think Tobias resents seeing me in a state of rest when he comes home from work, which he could probably do with seeing a therapist about. All of us need a little more rest in our lives – what’s so offensive about a woman sleeping during the day? It’s not like I don’t work; I just work in a different way. I like to say I’m neurodiverse, but Tobias doesn’t buy that. Just call me a maverick, then. I don’t plan on changing my routine. It makes me feel great. I could try to be a bit more sociable in the evening when Tobias wants to chat. But I don’t want to give up my naps.",innocent,medium
"Lily takes clippings from plants that aren’t hers. It’s setting a terrible example for our future child Lily and I love going to gardens and parks, but she takes cuttings off any plant she fancies. When we’re out on a walk, I feel awkward when she leans over to take a clipping. If I saw someone else doing it, I would be quite shocked. I don’t want to be the kind of person who cuts things off plants in the park. I respect rules and I like to follow them. The only way to live all together in society is to follow the rules, but Lily is the opposite and makes up her own. When we were walking through a local park recently, we got into an argument. I don’t even think you should be able to touch plants. There are signs like “Don’t sit on the grass” for a reason. Lily really wanted to take a clipping of rosemary from a bush and I told her not to. I said: “I’m sorry, but I don’t think we should cut any part of a public plant.” For me, it’s the principle. She said I was over the top: “It’s lovely to rebirth plants.” And she called me “mentally inflexible”. One time I saw Lily snap a branch. I was shocked – that was a bit extreme to me In our flat, we keep a few small plants in glasses from cuttings that Lily has taken. But I don’t think the gardener in our local park would love this practice. Lily is altering the state of a natural organism. We are having a baby in a month and have to decide how we are going to raise it. Is it appropriate for people to go around cutting public plants? I think not. I want to be respectful of our neighbourhood and its gardens. People’s judgments really matter to me. I want to be regarded as a good citizen and want our kids to be the same. One time I saw Lily snap a branch, which shocked me. You really have to put a lot of effort into snapping off a branch; that seemed a bit extreme to me. I don’t agree with Lily’s behaviour, but if she has to take cuttings, she should only take them from plants that are healthy, and not snap twigs off. When it comes to our children, I hope they will one day be old enough to understand how to look after the environment and at least take cuttings in a sustainable way.","A gardener or botanist wouldn’t begrudge me taking a small clipping – they’d support me, in fact I love taking small twigs or cuttings home and seeing how they grow in our flat. But Lars has a problem with the way I do it. He is worried about us being seen. I’ll take a leaf, which only involves a quick pluck, but when I snapped a branch from a plant in a park recently, he was horrified. He said it was because the park had just been freshly pruned and that I’d ruined it, but I don’t think the park looked any different. I also don’t think a gardener or botanist would begrudge me taking a small clipping – I’m confident they would support me, in fact. Lars and I had a big argument about it, which ruined our nice walk. At some point a public plant is going to be pruned anyway. Why not take a piece if you’re not harming it? When it comes to my cuttings, Lars says I’m only thinking about my own little life, whereas he’s looking at the bigger picture – but his rules and principles are way too strict. He says: “How would society function if everyone did this?” He thinks public parks would be destroyed if everyone took clippings whenever they wanted. But not everyone loves plants like me, so that argument doesn’t stand. At some point, a public plant is going to be pruned anyway, so why not take a piece of it as long as you’re not harming the plant? I only take clippings if a plant is healthy and bushy. I’m very discreet and don’t take one when anyone is looking or when it might leave a visible hole in the plant. Related: You be the judge: should my friend stop burping in public? I’ve only taken clippings on a few occasions. The first time was when I was on holiday with Lars. There’s something so appealing about taking a bit of a plant with you and seeing how it grows in your care. Every time you look at the plant at home you remember that trip. It’s romantic. The dispute has started since I’ve become pregnant, and I don’t understand why. I’m not expecting our baby to start cutting plants right after it leaves the womb. Obviously, I’ll teach our kids to be sensible, and educate them about sustainability. And I’m going to continue to take cuttings in secret when I go for a walk by myself.",guilty,medium
"She likes to put on music and burp to the beat. Her favourite is Sister Sledge’s We Are Family I find my best friend Rowena’s habit of burping in public quite disgusting. And she feels no remorse, which I find even worse. Every single time she eats or drinks, she seems to burp. Well, it’s probably not every single time, but it certainly feels like that. Rowena is an extremely gassy person – she burps in a way I’ve never heard before. They’re really low and long. It’s like something from a warthog. Why do we all have to be subjected to it? Her lack of embarrassment or shame about it is also weird. If I were to ever burp in public, I would immediately say sorry to everyone around me, but Rowena just finds it funny. We go out together often and I’ve seen the disgusted looks of people around us after she has let one rip. I’ve apologised to them on behalf of her. There are etiquette rules for a reason – to keep society in order. But Rowena revels in the shock factor Once she let out a huge burp after some beers and a man turned around, horrified. Instead of apologising she said, “better out than in!” I said to her: “Is it though? Is it really?” There are rules of etiquette for a reason; to keep society in order. But Rowena revels in the shock factor. She fully leans into it and enjoys putting on a show. Another time a man in the street called her disgusting after she belched really loudly after drinking a cider. Rowena tracked him down, then lectured him about how it’s all gendered and that men are more likely to be lauded for belching than women. I don’t know if that’s even true but it was a great defence. Anyway, the man repeated his insult and walked off, so it didn’t get her anywhere. I think she enjoyed, it though. I’ve been at dinner parties where she’s let out a few burps and noticed that some of our friends don’t like it either. But it’s kind of a running joke now – Rowena’s party piece. She likes to put on some music and burp along to the beat once she’s had a few drinks. Her favourite song to belch along with is Sister Sledge’s We Are Family . I don’t know why. I think Rowena needs to work on her gas issues. Take a tablet. Get a better diet. I can’t defend this behaviour any longer.","I’d never burp in anyone’s face. It’s just for a laugh when out with friends or after a few drinks I actually find holding gas in very uncomfortable. I think I’m one of those people who needs to let it out because I find it physically difficult to keep it in. I don’t know, maybe it’s my digestion, but I let them rip quite often in the confines of my own home and find it really satisfying. I feel lighter and less bloated after. When I’m out, I try to control my burping, but it’s hard. I just like the feeling of letting the trapped air out and yes, I admit, I do feel like my belching has become a bit of a party piece. I’ve learned to burp in a particular way. I can burp out partial sentences and burp in time with the music. Helena gets mortified if I do that in public, so I try not to make a burping scene unless we’re among friends, but even then she will still tell me off. She says: “Ro, that’s totally gross.” One time I met a stranger who I had a burping competition with in a bar I can see her point but I’d never burp in anyone’s face or anything. It’s just a bit of a laugh when we’re with friends or have had a few drinks. My burping gets worse with alcohol or fizzy drinks, and certain foods trigger it, too, like artichokes, cauliflower, beans and cabbage. Yes we’ve had a couple of incidents where people have told me off, and I get a bit sassy in response. I once told a woman that it’s not illegal to burp in public and she called me rude. When I tracked down a man in the street to tell him about gendered double standards, Helena had to drag me away. I don’t like people telling me off at all. Helena thinks I want to upset the social order. I think it’s more to do with my digestive system . But maybe my digestive system has made me a bit of a maverick. Who knows? Helena definitely loves a rule, which is why she always tells me off for burping. I accept that most other people don’t like it either. Once I met a stranger in a bar and we had a burping competition, but apart from that I seem to upset everyone when I burp in public. I can try and hold in my belching a little more, but it’s so satisfying I’m not sure I’ll succeed.",guilty,medium
"I cringe when he picks up a beaten-up plastic bottle in the gym, and I’m sick of seeing them in our flat My boyfriend John is an almost professional gym-goer, and plays football every weekend. He’s 6ft 4in and always exercising. He constantly gets stopped by other guys, who ask him for workout and muscle-building tips. Fitness is his life. John works in accounting but the gym, counting his protein and maintaining his build, is his side-hustle. But despite this, he is opposed to buying a proper water bottle. He carries around a big plastic one and only replaces it every month or so. I find it disgusting and there are always lots of empty plastic bottles lying around our flat. I think carrying around a plastic water bottle is less hygienic than having a stainless steel one that you can replace and wash. Stainless steel bottles are also way better for the environment and just look nice. It’s a bit childish to carry a plastic bottle in public all the time. Everyone at the gym has a nice, thermal insulated water bottle these days – except John. The longest he kept one plastic water bottle for – as far as I know – is three months. I ended up throwing it out I cringe when he picks up a beaten-up plastic one with the label peeling off and takes a swig of the lukewarm water. I nag him to replace it, but he will just say, “It’s fine”. John will leave the old plastic water bottle in our hot car, or out in the sun, and I worry about how wise that is when it hasn’t been replaced for a few weeks. The longest he kept one plastic water bottle was three months. I threw it out myself eventually. I have sent him links to stainless steel water bottles he could buy, but he says they are too expensive, or that I’m forcing him to make a change he doesn’t deem necessary. However, investing in a bottle is going to be cheaper compared with constantly buying water in the long-run. We’ve been together a year and I’m thinking of buying him one for his birthday, but I also slightly resent the idea of doing that, as I reckon it should be on John. I don’t want to force him to do it, but I’m also sick of looking at plastic bottles in our flat. Surely readers will agree that it makes sense for John to invest in a proper bottle himself.","ohn It will take two years for a steel water bottle to pay for itself. No one but Lara thinks my plastic ones are gross I may well end up investing in a stainless steel water bottle, but I don’t want to be forced into doing it. I’ve never had one and I think they are expensive for what they are. It’s true that I spend a lot of time in the gym, but I have always fared perfectly well reusing plastic water bottles. I was doing it before Lara and I met, and part of the reason I don’t care much about switching it up is because no one has ever pointed it out as annoying or gross before. It’s just a water bottle. Related: You be the judge: should my best friend relax about dating and babies? Lara says I will save money in the long-run if I buy a stainless steel one, but they cost about £25 these days, and I only change up my plastic water bottle every month or so, and they are still only £1. By that maths it will take me more than two years for the bottle to be worth the cost. However, Lara reminds me that I will also have invested in my health during that time as she worries about the quality of water sloshing around in an old plastic bottle, and I do get that. I could more regularly wash a water bottle made of steel or bamboo or whatever they are made of these days. But then again, that’s a lot of hassle. I see guys in my gym drinking from plastic water bottles too so I don’t think it’s as taboo as Lara makes out I prefer buying a bottle of water from the shop, and buying another one when I want to replace it. Yes it’s not the most environmentally friendly stance but that’s why I only replace it every month or so. The one time I kept a bottle for three months was an exception – I think I forgot to change it because it was holding up so well. Lara says there are lots of water bottles in our flat and that’s true. I like to just grab one and fill it up before I work out, but when it’s time to throw them out, I always recycle them. I see guys in my local gym drinking from plastic water bottles, too, so I don’t think it’s quite as taboo as Lara makes out. Lara is always telling me that it’s an “ick” when I drink from my plastic water bottle. I find that a little annoying. There’s lots of stuff men can’t do these days without apparently turning women off: drinking water from a bottle designed for that very purpose shouldn’t be one of them.",guilty,medium
"Other people using your toothbrush isn’t just weird, it’s disgusting and unhygienic When I stay with my wife Alice’s family, I face a big problem. If I leave my toothbrush out in the bathroom, I can guarantee it will get used by one of her siblings. Why do I have a problem with this? Well, brushing your teeth is a personal thing. Another person using your toothbrush is just weird. Why use mine when you could use your own? Why do you feel like you’re allowed to use my toothbrush? Do you not find it weird and disgusting that you’re using someone else’s toothbrush, when it’s got their plaque and germs on it? It’s gross. This not only happens whenever I stay with Alice’s family; incredibly, it also happens when her siblings have stayed at our house. They say that sharing toothbrushes is not a big deal. Apparently there was a pot of toothbrushes in their bathroom growing up, and when it came time to brush their teeth, everyone would just go for the nicest-looking one. By the time five people have used it one morning, it’ll be ruined, the bristles splayed, and I’ll have to buy a new one This habit has continued into adulthood, so wherever they go, they just pick the best toothbrush. I take good care of my toothbrush, so if I leave it out while they’re staying over, there’s a high chance one of them will use it. Or, more likely, all of them will use it. By the time five people have used it in one morning, it’ll be ruined, the bristles completely splayed, and I’ll have to buy a new one. So not only is the habit disgusting, it is also wasteful. Alice’s mum wouldn’t use my toothbrush, but I know that her two brothers and sister would. I’ve brought the matter up with Alice and she says: “Stop being silly – it’s just a toothbrush.” She doesn’t see a problem. And Alice’s sister told me to stop being “precious”. But I don’t think this is me being precious – they’ve all overstepped the line. Now I keep my toothbrush in our room. I’d love to leave it out in the bathroom, because it’s unnatural to move a toothbrush back and forth, but if I forget, someone will always use it. I can’t get Alice’s family to stick to my rule so I’ll just have to carry my toothbrush about with me.","Our family have always shared toothbrushes and we still do. Edward can be a bit of a princess The first thing you should know is that I grew up sharing things in a house of six. When you live with three siblings and your mum and dad, you just do whatever. We shared toothbrushes – we have done it our entire lives. I still do when I go home. I genuinely don’t think there’s anything unusual about it. My mum would replace the toothbrushes once a month, so that was fine. I thought everyone did it. It didn’t occur to me that it was disgusting. Edward didn’t know for a really long time that everyone in my house was using his toothbrush when he stayed over. He used to be like, “Why is my toothbrush wet?” I didn’t say anything for a while. But he had a very beautiful, pristine toothbrush, whereas Mum used to just get a pack of Aldi ones. My siblings wouldn’t have known it was his, though. They would have just seen it and thought: “I’ll be using that one tonight.” Edward saw one of my brothers using his toothbrush once and felt absolute horror. He started hiding it when we went to stay, and he still does. My siblings thought: “Why is he freaking out? We all share in this house.” Even though we’re adults, they see sharing toothbrushes as totally normal, as I do. I think it’s funny that he keeps his toothbrush under lock and key – and my siblings think it’s hilarious Edward and I started going out at 17 and we’re now 32. I have known him for more than half my life and he’s always been quite fussy. My house was always full of people and noise; his family is very different. When I met him I was shocked at how much privacy he had. He lived in a big townhouse with just his mum and had a whole floor to himself, whereas I wasn’t raised like that. Edward is a bit of a princess. He has got around the issue by taking his toothbrush back into the bedroom whenever he stays at my family home. I think it’s funny that he keeps it under lock and key, and my family think it’s hilarious. They take the piss out of him for being a stiff-necked loser. I tell him to chill out about the toothbrush thing – I think sharing is charming.",guilty,high
"We both lead full lives, so why the rush to settle down and have kids? Liz worries too much My best friend and housemate Liz is 32, like me, and an all-round fabulous human being. But she’s obsessed with dating and babies and just won’t let up on the subject. She’s always sharing toddler memes. I think she thought she would be the first in our group to get married and have kids, but she broke up with an ex two years ago. We moved in together then. Liz says she’s feeling the pressure to find someone, as most of our friends are married or dating, and I empathise. I’m in the same boat. We live in a big city where app dating is de rigueur. Though while I take breaks from dating because I find apps tiring, Liz is constantly chatting to someone. I know her baby focus is driving this, but sometimes I wish she’d slow down. Liz also regurgitates a lot of toxic information about fertility that I don’t think is true. At the heart of all this she really is worried about not having a baby by the magic age she has in her head, which is 37 I remind her that we have lots of time left and that having a baby with the wrong person would be worse, but sometimes it falls on deaf ears. She’s literally said: “I’m running out of time.” I think she should relax a bit. Living with Liz is so much fun. We have girly chats about our dating escapades, and lots of nights in, but when she’s seeing someone she can completely fall off the radar. She was dating a guy for three months recently, and for that whole period I didn’t see her – she was constantly at his. Unfortunately it didn’t work out. I was happy to be a shoulder to cry on, but the next week Liz was on another date. She gets so invested each time. I know that at the heart of all this is her worry about not having a baby by the magic age she has in her head, which is 37, but that’s five years away. I don’t think it would be the worst thing in the world for either of us if it didn’t happen by 37, because we lead full, interesting lives. Liz tells me it’s not the same for me as I am married to my job as a lawyer, whereas she is an artist and has more time on her hands. I also want kids and a partner, but I’m just happy to wait until the right person comes along. I’d love for Liz to try to stay focused on herself until the same happens for her.","I tend to dive in headfirst but dating is what I want to prioritise right now I am dating a lot at the moment, but so are all my friends. I think there’s more pressure on all of us since turning 30, because the biological clock is ticking. Maggie says I read too much information about fertility and babies, but the stats and facts that I find online can’t all be wrong. I know that there’s no “magic age” for getting pregnant, but I’d personally like to be all sorted before 37. My mum had her third child by then, but at this rate I would love to have had just one. I probably do date more than Maggie, and because we live together she notices it more than our other friends. My job isn’t as consuming, and dating is what I want to prioritise right now. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. Maggie once stopped talking to a guy because he wore odd socks to a fancy restaurant date Maggie and I have known each other since university, where I had a long-term boyfriend. I suppose I was the one who talked about marriage and babies the most, because I was the only one in a relationship. But that ended after graduation. I got into another relationship, which ended after five years. I’ve been to a few weddings in the past year, which is maybe why I’ve amped up the dating. Maggie and I moved in together after both finding ourselves single at 30. It’s been great, but I do think we have different approaches to dating. Maggie is much more matter of fact. She will cut someone off for any little discrepancy. She once stopped talking to a guy just because he wore odd socks on a fancy dinner date. I am much more “let’s see how it goes” but I also tend to dive in head-first which Maggie says is my biggest mistake. I appreciate her words of comfort in hard times, and of course when she has a bad date or two, I do the same for her. I know she wants what’s best for me and I could definitely be more communicative with her when I’m dating someone – she said that I disappear and that’s true. But I do want to find a partner and that is taking a large portion of my energy.",None,None
"If you don’t like a book, there’s no point keeping it. Rupert needs to let some things go Rupert is possessive about his books. He doesn’t want to get rid of any, ever, and he gets quite particular about people touching them or messing them up. He hates it if I fold down a corner of a page or do anything that may damage one of his books slightly. I borrowed one of his novels to read on holiday and it got a bit damaged, as I was camping and a cow tried to eat it. He wasn’t happy when I gave it back. I also felt anxious recently when my friend borrowed a book of his and planned to read it at the beach. I think books should be able to put up with a bit of wear and tear, but he doesn’t agree. We often read the same books, but I’m just not as attached to them. We moved in together a few months ago after knowing each other for a year, and the book thing quickly became an issue. We have two really nice bookshelves in our living room and I like the way I’ve laid them out, but Rupert wants to get more shelves. I’d rather throw out or donate some books before we get more shelves. I want things around our home we both like. If we don’t enjoy a book, why keep it? I said it’s fine to add to the shelves, but because we have limited space I think Rupert ought to have a clearout of some of his books. However, he wants to keep every one of them. We recently moved to a new country and he shipped all his books here, whereas I only brought a couple. I think that sums up our different stances. We are both teachers, and Rupert says he likes reading children’s books to stay abreast of reading trends and to lend books to the kids in his school. But I don’t think he lends books as often as he says he does. We had a disagreement on holiday recently because Rupert was reading a children’s book he didn’t really enjoy but still wanted to cart it around with us for weeks. I told him to leave it where we were staying, and he gave in eventually, but I had to fight with him. I don’t mind Rupert’s love of books, but I want to keep things around our home that we both like. If we don’t enjoy a book, we don’t need to keep it. I also think if you lend a book to someone, there’s a chance it might get a bit damaged – that’s just life.","Books are my passion. We should get more bookshelves rather than throw them out Reading is my main hobby and books are a big part of me. If I like a book, I want to keep it. I accept that I was in the wrong when I refused to throw away that book on holiday, but I don’t think I’m bad at lending books in general. I’ve got a lot better, in fact. If people take care of my books it’s fine, but I don’t want them to come back dog-eared or with the pages marked. I did lend Ari’s friend a book recently and it went fine. I didn’t know Ari felt anxious about the loan though. I will generally follow up with people who have borrowed one of my books: I’ll send a message a few months in, saying, “Hey, how are you getting on?” Perhaps I’m still a bit reluctant as I have lent books before and not got them back. Although when Ari came back from holiday with the book that had been almost chewed by a cow, I actually laughed about it. We are both teachers and have similar tastes in adult fiction. I read more YA though. I like reading fantasy children’s books and, as a primary school teacher, I think it’s good to stay on top of on what’s trending in that genre. Though I do get Ari’s point about throwing out old children’s books, as we don’t live with kids. I’ve taken a few YA books into school recently as a compromise. Our shelves are not overcrowded. And I would like to expand my collection. When we moved, my old employers paid for my books to be shipped out to my new address, so of course I brought my personal collection over. Though if I hadn’t been given that option, I would have kept them in storage rather than throw them away. Ari and I are both tidy, but she is definitely better at the decor. I don’t have a problem with the fact that the bookshelves are used to display plants and pictures: it looks lovely. Our shelves are not overcrowded. But I do think we should just get more shelves so I can expand my collection. Books are my passion. And if I’ve really enjoyed a book, or it has a nice cover, or it’s for work, I will want to keep it. And when it comes to people borrowing them, I always expect them to come back in the condition I lent them in. That’s reasonable.",innocent,medium
"If Dad’s offered to keep Theo company, then falls asleep on him, what’s the point in coming? My dad Brian comes to my flat often, as he is on his own and so am I. My mum passed away four years ago and I don’t get much help from my ex-partner. Dad and I have got closer since Mum died, and I know he loves the company. I’m grateful that twice a week, when I’m at work, Dad watches Theo, my son, who is 11, and feeds our dog Betsy, a 12-year-old labrador who still has a lot of energy. But Dad often falls asleep at mine. He says it’s because my sofa is super comfy and he feels at home, which is lovely – my home is his home. Theo says he doesn’t like to wake up his grandpa, and he’s pretty much old enough to look after himself, but if Dad’s offered to come and cook Theo’s dinner and keep him company, then falls asleep on him, what’s the point in coming? Theo isn’t yet an adult and I worry Dad will fall asleep with the oven on or something He also snores, which is a bit antisocial. You can’t think when he’s asleep; all you can hear is this rattling, like a drill going off. He’s getting on a bit now, so I get that he needs his naps, but I’d prefer it if he didn’t come to mine just to sleep, though he says he doesn’t mean to. When I get home, I’ll ask Theo: how long has he been sleeping? Often it’s after he’s made their dinner and done whatever else I’ve asked him to help with. After the chores, he’s zonked. Theo isn’t yet an adult and I worry Dad will fall asleep with the oven on or something. It also takes Dad about 30 minutes before he can hold a coherent conversation after waking. He should watch his weight too, as that’s linked to snoring – he has a pot belly now. Failing that, he should ensure he gets enough sleep before coming to ours.","I’ve come to help out, so I should be allowed a little nap At 76, I concede that my body emits a thunderous noise when I nod off. It wasn’t that bad 10 or 15 years ago, but Lisa tells me it’s unbearable now. I do try to stay awake, but at my age, when nap time calls, you have no choice but to answer. I’m not senile, so there’s no danger of me burning the house down while I’m asleep. I cook first, walk the dog, then retire to the sofa. I will pay a visit to Lisa on the odd weekend, but also on Wednesdays and Fridays when I pick up Theo from school. This helps Lisa with childcare costs too, as she works full-time. After we’ve done the dinner and homework, Theo wants to go off to play on his games console I like picking up Theo. He’s a confident, chatty lad and I like to hear about his school life and what he’s up to. But Theo is at that age where he enjoys his own company, so after dinner and homework he goes off to play on his games console. Lisa says, “Can you stay awake and watch him more?”, but he doesn’t need me to. Related: The multi-generation game: is living with your parents and your children a good idea? So when Theo goes off, that leaves me and the dog, Betsy, in the front room. And Betsy is like me – full of life but getting on a bit – so we have a nap together until Lisa returns. Lisa says she comes back and makes a racket in the kitchen and I still don’t wake up because I’m such a deep sleeper. She says it’s antisocial, but I can’t help it. I’ve come to help out, so I should be allowed a little nap. Lisa says I should watch my weight because snoring and being overweight are linked. I think that’s rubbish. I’m here to pick up Theo and make the tea – I don’t think I can do much more. Theo doesn’t mind, and Lisa only has to endure it for a short period. No big deal really.",None,None
"Mum says I’m spoiling Amber because I have buy conditioners that are free from chemicals I have a funny relationship with my mum about hair, and I put it down to generational differences. But I don’t want anything weird to get passed on to my daughter, Amber. Myself, Amber and my mum, Val, are black and mixed race. My father is white, as is my husband, Dave. Mum’s views are quite old-school. On a family holiday recently, she laughed at all the products in Amber’s haircare routine that I’ve bought. She said I was spoiling her because I have invested in proper conditioners that are free from chemicals. Mum’s hair is looser and goes into ringlets, but growing up I was used to seeing her with straightened hair that she relaxed. My own hair is much more tightly coiled and it felt like Mum had very little time for it. I was made to get a relaxer from age 11 to 17 but it was very strong. When I learned how bad that was for me, I started letting my hair breathe and discovered braids and weaves. A good routine and natural styles are important for not just her hair, but her identity too Gradually, after years of breakage, my hair recovered. Amber is seven and her hair is quite similar to mine. I will not relax her hair, ever, and often let her choose her own styles. Mum says I am spending too much money on Amber’s hair because I have invested in natural haircare products and regularly take her to really nice black hair salons. A good routine and natural styles are important for not just her hair, but her identity too. Mum encouraged me not to get braids when I was younger because she doesn’t like them. She is very proud of being a black Caribbean woman, but I think she’s internalised some shame around certain black hairstyles. I don’t want that for Amber, so Mum needs to butt out.","When I said Amber should relax her hair, it was only a suggestion. But Shanice reacted as if I’d said a dirty word I stand accused of having outdated views on afro hair, and I guess I do. But at 74, my beliefs are going to be different to Shanice’s. She reads too much. She’s always quoting something from the internet or some book she’s picked up about beauty and womanhood. I support all that, but I don’t like being lectured to. I think Shanice is a little sour about the fact I relaxed her hair, but I don’t try to control what Amber does with her hair. I know it’s not fashionable to use a relaxer now, but back then all Shanice’s friends were doing it, too. I was doing it – and I still do, although a little less because Shanice has told me about all the harmful chemicals. When I said Amber should relax her hair, it was only a suggestion. But Shanice reacted as if I’d said a dirty word. I told Shanice it would make her life easier as she wouldn’t have to spend so much money on styling and products, but she was very angry with me. She takes great care of Amber’s hair and is very proud of that. Amber knows all these terms and phrases about afro hair that I never had a clue about. She will come up to me and look at my shampoos and say “This one’s got parabens Nan, you should throw it out”. It’s very funny but sometimes I think she knows too much for her age. Does a seven-year-old need to be reading the labels of all their conditioners? I don’t think so. Shanice spends way too much money on all these natural creams and potions for Amber’s hair I wouldn’t say I struggle to do Amber’s hair type, but it is very similar to Shanice’s. They have coarse hair but it’s still beautiful. When Amber stayed over at our house, I just didn’t know how to put it in the bedtime style she wanted, as I never really did Shanice’s hair in a similar way. She always had it relaxed, or in two simple French braids, or cornrows. Shanice spends way too much money on all these natural creams and potions for Amber’s hair. I have said to her that I think it’s unnecessary and expensive, but of course she doesn’t appreciate my opinion. She says my language is “harmful”. It’s lovely that she’s so passionate about Amber’s hair, but I think she should try to keep her life – and Amber’s – simple by spending less time and effort on all these hair creams. Sometimes I think she just wants to be different for the sake of it.",guilty,high
"Mum says she wants to chill now – I’m fine with that, but I wish she’d stick to what she originally said Luna, my 10-month-old baby, is the light of my life. My boyfriend Tim and I love being parents, bar the total lack of sleep. We live close to my mum, Rita, and asked her if she would help out with the childcare, so I can go back to work when Luna turns one. Mum was up for it when we discussed it ages ago, but now the time has come she says she wants to go travelling for a few months. She is retired, divorced my dad five years ago and wants to have some adventures. She’d like to go back to India, where lots of her family live, and do a yoga retreat. Money is running quite low and my maternity leave ends soon, so I’d like to go back to work as soon as possible. Mum says she wants to enjoy what’s left of her life, but time with her grandchild will only come around once My mum is 62 and says she wants to enjoy what’s left of her life, which I totally understand, but time with her grandchild will only come around once. Luna is her first grandkid as I am an only child. She’s also really easy to look after. Mum came around to help out in the early weeks, but now things have settled she hasn’t been as present. I have friends whose mums moved in with them after they had babies. I wouldn’t want that, but it would be nice if Mum was more involved. Tim and I love it when she pops by, but she just dispenses a bit of advice then heads off before our tea is finished. Mum says she has raised her kid and now wants to “chill”. I’m fine with that, but I wish she’d stick to what she originally said. We’ll have to move things around to accommodate Mum and I’m pretty sure we can’t afford full-time childcare.","At 62, I’ve earned the right to call the shots. I want to reconnect with my roots I said I’d only do the baby thing once, and I did. I raised Zara for 25 years, and during all that time I never wanted any more kids. One was enough. Now Zara wants a hand with childcare and I will of course oblige, but I said it has to be convenient for me too. At 62, I’ve earned the right to call the shots a bit – I want to see the world and reconnect with my roots. I have plans to go back to India, where my parents were from, and that means I can only really start helping out after I get back. I won’t apologise for wanting to travel and have fun first. Life is for living, and I’d like to make the most of what’s left of mine. Yes, that involves spending time with family, especially my grandchild, but I don’t want to be relied upon for free labour. Zara said she was happy for me when I said I wanted to use some of my retirement savings to travel, but now I’ve told her when I plan on going she’s been trying to dictate my schedule. But I need to go soon. I’ve been putting it off for years. My ex-husband had little interest in travelling to India, so it took me a while to pluck up the courage to plan everything. I said I’d be around to help out when I can, but I don’t plan on staying around the corner for ever until I pop my clogs It’s difficult as a new parent to keep all the plates spinning. Zara is lucky in that she has Tim, just as I was to have my ex-husband, but the main responsibility for looking after a child lies with the parents. Zara is excellent with Luna and I’m very proud of her. I said I’d be around to help out when I can, but I don’t plan on staying around the corner for ever until I pop my clogs. I’ve still got things I want to do. Zara is all grown up – it’s up to her and Tim to decide how they run their house. As my own dear mum used to say: I’ve done my time.",innocent,high
"I often ask Mum to go easy on the desserts, but she says kids deserve treats My parents, Conall and Maureen, love their grandkids, but they go against my wishes when it comes to feeding them. Áine is five and Joey is three – my husband, James, and I have strict requirements for their diets. My mum is a great cook but she’s not into clean eating, unlike James and me. She loves to make quick, easy things for their lunches, like cheesy pizza breads, whereas I give them meals that are a bit lighter but perhaps more complicated to prepare, like crudités, hummus and prawns. If they’re with their grandparents for the day, I might provide a packed lunch for them so they can keep to their routine. But if they also stay for dinner, Mum will cook heavy meals, like steak and ale pie with buttery mash and crumble for dessert. At home we have things like salmon and veg, or chicken arrabbiata stew with greens. I’m trying to teach Áine and Joey the importance of natural, simple cooking. Sometimes when I collect the kids, they are bouncing off the walls because of all the sugar they’ve consumed Sometimes my parents pick up the kids from school, or take them if we have a weekend away. I appreciate that, and Áine and Joey always have a great time, but they get to eat these rich foods we’ve banned. I’ll often ask Mum to go easy on the desserts, but she says kids deserve treats. Sometimes when I collect them, they are bouncing off the walls from all the sugar they’ve consumed. Also, my dad always feeds them biscuits. He says, “One won’t hurt”, then gives them free rein of the biscuit tin. I’m the one who has to deal with the ramifications, long-term (rotten teeth) and short (hyperactivity). I might sound like a grinch, but it’s for their own good.","They’re kids, for god’s sake, they like sweet things and need a bit of balance We were never as strict with Orlaith as she is with Áine and Joey, so we’re not sure where she gets it from. We had plenty of rules for Orlaith growing up, but there wasn’t as much emphasis on diet. It was more around routines: go to mass, get your homework done. But food-wise we just ate normal family meals, and still do. There’s nothing wrong with a shortcrust pie or a roast dinner; it’s classic cooking. The only thing is that Orlaith has moved away from the food she grew up on; now it’s all green juice and tofu. There’s a sugar ban for the kids and red meat is rarely eaten. Orlaith is a bit obsessed with health. She’s definitely conscious of her figure, and we think she’ll pass that on to the kids if she’s not careful. Orlaith ate chocolate growing up and her teeth are fine A treat now and then never hurts. They’re kids, for god’s sake. They like sweet things and need a bit of balance. We like treating them, but we’ve been told off when we’ve given them a dessert or let them have a few biscuits. Orlaith will say, “You’ve made the kids hyperactive”, but they’re five and three so they’ll be hyperactive anyway. She’s also very worried about their teeth. But Orlaith ate chocolate growing up and her teeth are fine. If the kids see us eating cake, of course they want it too. Sometimes we won’t tell Orlaith, but the kids usually tell her in their excitement, then we get a telling off. Orlaith is a very good mother, but she needs to relax a bit when it comes to their eating habits.",innocent,medium
"Damien doesn’t agree that his dog’s food is to blame for the moths, and he refuses to seal it away We’ve had a really bad infestation of pantry moths in our kitchen for some time now. Every time I come downstairs for breakfast I will see what looks like a new one hanging upside down in our cupboards, and at night they seem to follow me around the kitchen like little shadows. They are very distinctive – brown with white and grey patches on their backs. We don’t know how they got into the house, but I suspect it was Damien’s doing as he orders in dog food for his pitbull, Betsy, and I have read that they often come in via pet food. Damien says it’s too much effort to decant everything into glass jars, but I told him it’s necessary We are now in the throes of the second infestation. After the first one, I cleaned out our cupboards very thoroughly, wiped all the surfaces, got rid of any cocoons I could see hanging in corners and threw out every open bag of food. The moths feed on dried foods, so I got rid of all my expensive muesli, which was heartbreaking, and all the baking items. I thought we were rid of them, but about two weeks later Damien got a shipment of dog food and within a few days I noticed moths fluttering around the house again. This time I was better prepared, so all the pastas and grains were stored in glass jars. But Damien remained nonchalant. He didn’t accept that the dog food was the culprit and he didn’t make any attempt to tie up the bag after feeding Betsy. I’ve asked him to seal everything up each time, but he is very careless. He rarely seals the food he stores in the cupboard for himself, either. Damien says it’s “too much effort” to decant everything into glass jars and plastic boxes, but I told him it’s necessary to cut off the moth’s food supply, so why isn’t he more bothered? He’s 24 and just bone idle. It takes 30 seconds to tip some Coco Pops into a jar, but he won’t do it. Now the moths are back and they are having a field day. Damien says I am “accusing” him of making the situation worse. Both he and my husband say I’m paranoid. But if Damien doesn’t change his view, the moths are only going to get worse.","Mum is paranoid – the dog food isn’t the problem. And if I do eat a moth’s egg, they’re not harmful There’s no proof that the pet food I buy for Betsy created the moth issue in our house. We’ve had them for ages now and I don’t know why it’s being linked to me. My dad agrees with me. We even did some research online and it turns out these moths could have come into the home in various ways, including via Mum’s cereal or her packs of flour. She bakes a lot and the moths love sugar, so why isn’t Mum examining her own role in this? I don’t think it’s fair that I’m getting all the blame. Yes, I could be better at sealing up the dog food bag, but Mum is now so paranoid about it all. She will literally hear the rustle of the bag from upstairs and then come running into the kitchen shouting about doing it back up, and inspecting the walls for these moths. She will shout: “Another one!” and get the tea towel out and try to swat them away. It’s all pretty dramatic and they are only tiny things. I don’t really see the harm in them and I don’t like being told that I am the reason for their existence. I’ve never seen any moths flying in or out of the dog food bag so I think she’s jumped to conclusions I’ve even Googled whether eating moth eggs is harmful, and it turns out it’s not. Obviously it’s not super-hygienic, but my point is the moths aren’t a big deal. I would say that at any given time in the kitchen, you can only see a couple of them. And Mum has now tipped every single dry food item into a jar or plastic container, so the moths will die out. I don’t deserve the blame for the moths being in Betsy’s food. They have cocoons right in the corner of the kitchen ceiling and Mum may have missed some when she was clearing out. I can try to reseal Betsy’s food bag, but I won’t be decanting it as it’s 15kg and that would just be a waste of time. Also, we’ve never actually seen any moths flying in or out of the dog food bag – or I haven’t – so I really think she’s jumped to conclusions. The moths are a pain but they aren’t the end of the world. I can make more of an attempt to seal up my cereal but if I end up eating a moth egg I’m honestly not that bothered.",guilty,high
"David says the table runner I bought for him in Nicaragua ‘hurts his eyes’ I brought back several gifts for my boyfriend David from recent trip around Central America, but I feel they were unappreciated. I got him a gorgeous pink, orange and blue table runner, handmade by women on a farm in Nicaragua. I also got him some scented candles for our bedroom, a faded red leather backpack, a woven bracelet and two cushion covers from Costa Rica with a colourful bird print on them. David is quite a simple man: he doesn’t do a lot of crazy colours, but he has had a visceral reaction to the table runner in our flat. He says it’s “a bit much” and suggested we put it in the study room instead of on our dining table. But it’s a table runner – the clue’s in the name – so I said no and put it on our table. He’s made a few comments – he says it hurts his eyes and he can’t concentrate on his dinner. I told him to stop being so ridiculous, but I am a little hurt. We’ve been together for three years and I’ve slowly been working to make his clothing and decor tastes more adventurous The bracelet I got him has also remained unworn. He says he’s grateful but it’s not really “his style”, so it seems that was a waste of money. I’ve seen him use the backpack, so I’m happy about that. When it comes to the cushion covers, David said they were “very interesting”, but in the same breath mentioned that we already have some and don’t need to change them. (And I do admit, the cushions’ pattern is overly vibrant). I went away for four weeks on this solo travel trip and thought he’d be happy to get some funky gifts from Central America. Our flat needs an update too. We’ve been together for three years and I have slowly been working to make his clothing and decor tastes a little more adventurous. David could show more interest in that, though. I’d love for him to come up with alternatives. He could even be a bit more vocal about why he doesn’t like something. I wouldn’t be offended, but he tends to avoid conflict and disagreements. He will slyly avoid saying what he really means, which is not super helpful.","It’s not that I hate the gifts, but I feel that Lua bought them for the flat, not for me It’s not that I hated Lua’s presents, it’s just that I don’t think they are in keeping with my personal style, or what we’ve got going on in the flat. The table runner Lua brought back from her travels was honestly really garish, but I didn’t want to hurt her feelings so I just quietly moved it to the study after she presented it to me. She didn’t like that, and it soon returned to its original position. However, it sort of raises the question: was the table runner a present for me, or for us? It seems Lua wanted to buy it for the flat, so I wasn’t going to have much of a say about its position either way. The same goes for the cushion covers. Lua needs to admit that she saw them abroad and thought, “Oh, they will be lovely for the flat”, not, “This will make a nice gift.” I avoid saying anything negative because how do you tell someone you don’t like something they bought for you? I’d actually be fine with putting the cushion covers on now – I concede they were a very thoughtful idea and definitely a step-up from our old, stained navy ones. I think I just needed to get used to the brightness of them. Apart from the house stuff, I was very grateful for the backpack as my laptop fits it perfectly. It’s 100% my style, so that was a gift I loved. Even though it’s not something I’d usually wear, I’ll give the woven black bracelet a go because I love Lua and I want her to know I appreciate her. I know she thinks I’m a bit passive when it comes to expressing how I feel, but I don’t want to offend her. I will just sort of avoid saying anything negative from now on because, for one thing, it’s really difficult to tell someone you don’t like something they have bought for you. When it comes to the decor in our flat, it’s probably accurate to say that I am very averse to change. I like things to stay the same. However, I have reasoned that because I don’t suggest any alternatives, it’s fair enough for her to come in and change things without asking for my approval each and every time. I could be a bit more involved, I suppose.",innocent,high
"I’m really worried about how Mona will be perceived when she starts applying for jobs Mona loves being a bit out there: she always has. Mona has purple hair one week, green the next. She gave herself about 10 ear piercings when she was 14, and she fills them all with tiny earrings now. I noticed the first face piercing at 16 straight away – it was a small hoop through her nose. I thought she was too young and told her repeatedly to take it out, but she ignored me. The rule was: you can do what you want when you move out, but while you’re in my house I’d like you to refrain from piercings and tattoos. It’s out of respect but, also I don’t really like looking at all those things Mona does to herself. The nose piercing was a point of contention for a while, and then I stopped mentioning it. However, I was quite upset with the large tattoo she got on her inner arm, two years later, at 18. Tattoos are permanent and this one is noticeable: lots of shading and leaves. I told her: “While you’re under my roof I don’t want to see any more.” Mona said that was fine, but then she went off to university and every time she came back for the holidays, there was another tattoo or piercing. She has little tattoos on her ankle, a huge one on her lower back and she’s added to the one on her arm – but those are just the ones I can see. I don’t actually know how many she has. As she’s my daughter and she’s living with me, I think I have a right to try and maintain some order I don’t think Mona looks silly – some of the tattoos are quite pretty – but I’m concerned about how she will be perceived when she starts applying for jobs. I worry what it will look like when she’s older, but she just laughs at me. Mona moved back home with me a few months ago as she’s 21 and recently graduated. I don’t know if she’s planning more tattoos but I don’t want to see any more. Mona once said I’m denying her “bodily autonomy” and that I’m controlling, but as she’s my daughter and she’s living with me, I think I have a right to try and maintain some order. It may be her body, but I won’t allow her to abuse it with endless tattoos. She needs to focus on getting serious employment as she’s just interning at a design agency at the moment. When she moves out, she can do what she pleases.","My mum is just being old-fashioned. It’s my body and I should be allowed to do what I want with it My mum is old-school, Catholic and Irish. She grew up in a strict family on a farm in the 1960s, so of course she doesn’t understand the concept of developing a personal style that’s different from the norm. Her whole life has been about conforming and not drawing attention to herself. I don’t subscribe to all that. I think it’s important for everyone to present how they want. If you’re not harming anyone, who cares whether your hair is blue or if you’re covered in metal? My tattoos and piercings are an extension of myself, as well as an expression of my personality and individuality, so naturally they are important to me. When my mum criticises how I look, or tells me not to get any more “body modifications”, I do take it personally. When I got my nose piercing at 16, I didn’t hear the end of it for months. She told me I looked like a bull and that I should take the hoop out (I didn’t). The fallout was so great that I waited until I was living away from home before I got anything else done. For now I want an easy life so I guess things are on pause, but that won’t last for ever When I was at university I started experimenting with tattoos and more piercings and then when I came back for the holidays I’d always get a snarky comment or an over-the-top reaction. Now I’m back home for a bit and interning. My mum has said I’m not allowed to get anything else done tattoo-wise. Part of me wants to follow this rule to just make sure we don’t argue, but on the other hand I think it’s a weird request. I’m an adult. It’s my body. Telling me what to do with my body is a direct attack on my personal rights. It’s the denial of my autonomy, just because we live under the same roof. What right does my mum have to tell me not to get another tattoo or piercing? It’s really got nothing to do with her. I have 12 tattoos so far and I will undoubtedly add to that, but for now I want an easy life so I guess things are on pause. But that won’t last forever and I don’t have to obey these old-fashioned, arbitrary rules just to keep my mum happy. I love her but she can’t tell me what to do.",innocent,high
"She’ll forget the oven is on and the trays are inside, leaving an acrid smell of burnt garlic bread Rita gets a pass on pretty much everything at the moment, as she’s 36 weeks pregnant, but the one longstanding issue is that she often leaves our baking trays in the oven. I would prefer to keep them on the countertop. Rita is a multitasker. She’ll often be working from home, then before lunchtime, she’ll turn on the oven. It’s her way of saying it’s time to eat. She assumes that the oven will take time to warm up, but it actually gets hot really quickly, and in the meantime Rita will go and sit back down. She’ll forget the oven is on, and that the trays are inside. I’ll then notice a smouldering, acrid smell and get up to sort it out. I’ll go to the kitchen and take the trays out quite noisily, to make a point, but it’s tough as the trays have been heated to volcanic rock temperature and I can’t see anything for the smoke. One tray has usually got some outline of a garlic baguette or something that has been left in and burned to a crisp. Rita also often keeps the windows closed when she’s cooking, so the smoke is worse. I’ll go to the kitchen and take the trays out quite noisily, to make a point Before my current job, I worked as a cook and washed pans. I did two shifts a day and then I’d go back home to our kitchen and start cooking again, which I didn’t love. I think that’s why the smell of burning trays annoys me – I really hate it. I can be passive aggressive when I realise what Rita’s done. I love Rita dearly and we generally work well together. Our kitchen is tiny, with everything hanging up to make the most of the space, but we make it work. I’d like to keep the baking trays on the side, to save space, but Rita prefers to keep them in the oven. She says we don’t have room for them on the countertop. But they get used all the time, so they wouldn’t just be always sitting there. Now, before I start cooking, I always have to check if the baking trays are inside the oven, when Rita should really just keep them permanently on the side. That would also save my sense of smell and my eyes.","There’s not enough cupboard space, and I don’t see a problem with creating some smoke We live in a really small terrace property. The house makes the most of every bit of space we have for storage, but we’ve no real cupboard space in our kitchen. Everything is out, hanging up and on show. I prefer to store the baking trays in the oven; I don’t want them out as we don’t have the room. I do sometimes forget they are in the oven. I’ll turn on the oven and accidentally create some smoke. I don’t see a huge problem with that, though. You just take the trays out, and they cool down. But Sinbad has an extremely powerful sense of smell. Even if he’s two storeys above the kitchen in our loft, he’ll smell it. He will call down and say: “You’ve left the baking trays in the oven.” I have baby brain at the moment, I suppose. But I was also once nicknamed “the octopus” by a friend, because I am always doing something, and am generally good at multitasking. But when it’s time to cook, I still find that I prioritise working. I will start the process of making lunch, and then remember there are more important things than eating. One of the baking trays has sentimental value. I don’t want to throw it away, even though it smokes a lot Sinbad will always store the trays outside the oven. I’ll walk in the kitchen every day and see that he has propped them up on the side, which is annoying. We’ve been together 14 years. Sinbad has a background in cooking and he’s definitely a better cook, but he does like to be in control. When we are cooking, I have to take the back seat. Sinbad finds it quite difficult to be a sous chef. My sense of smell got stronger during pregnancy at one point, so I empathised with Sinbad more when the trays started smoking. Sometimes I’ll hear Sinbad fumbling around in the kitchen when I’ve forgotten to take them out, and hear him complaining. I’ll think: “Oh no,” but then: “Oh, he will get over it in a minute.” One of the baking trays has sentimental value. It’s probably about 25 years old but I don’t want to throw it away, even though it smokes a lot. We could use tinfoil on them, but I think Sinbad wouldn’t like that as he’s very eco-friendly and averse to waste. I also don’t think it would solve the problem of the smoking smell. However, I don’t want to store the baking trays on the countertop. We don’t have the space.",guilty,medium
"Of course Mum can see who she likes, but I find it hard to have men who aren’t my dad in our home The dynamic between me and my mum has always been tricky, even though I love her a lot. We never used to see eye to eye when I was a teenager. I felt she didn’t show much interest in my life, and we were very different. She didn’t get me, and I didn’t get her. Now I’m 23, and we are much closer, although our relationship changed a lot when my dad moved out three years ago. My parents are not divorced, but they aren’t together and their marriage had been rocky for a while. My sister Lizzy moved out last year, but I’m still at home as I can’t afford to rent on my own at the moment. I’m lucky that my mum doesn’t charge me anything, but I’m finding it hard to deal with her new relationships. Of course she can do what she wants, but sometimes I find it hard. Her latest partner comes around a lot – I’d rather not have to make small talk with him She was seeing someone a while back who my sister and I really disapproved of. He was overbearing and talked over us. I remember coming home from work to see this guy walking around, telling us what he would change around the place. He said we needed faster wifi and a different light fitting. I was thinking, “Who are you, mate?” Mum didn’t go out with him for long, but it felt wrong having someone like that in our home who wasn’t our dad. Another time she dated a guy who was really rude to Lizzy. He criticised her food choices because she doesn’t eat meat, and my mum didn’t stick up for her. That irritated me. Her latest partner comes around a lot, and, although he’s polite and keeps to himself, I’d rather not have to make small talk with him. He stays over occasionally and Mum has never run that past me. I just wake up – and suddenly he’s there. She says: “I don’t have to ask your permission to date”, but I’d just like to know if there’s going to be a man around. I like to walk around in my underwear and feel comfortable and I can’t do that with someone else there. I want Mum to be happy, but I think it’s hard for her to understand how it feels to see her with someone else who isn’t my dad in our home. I think she just sees it as me trying to be difficult.","I have to move on and live my life – and this is my house. I’d love Dina to get to know my new guy Dina loves to dictate her choices to me. “Dina the dictator”, I call her. As if I’m not going to live life how I want to in my own house. It is also Dina’s home, and she’s welcome to stay for as long as she needs, but if she doesn’t like me having someone over, she can go off and run her own house (that’s a joke – I’d never kick her out). I know the girls found it hard when I broke up with their father, but it wasn’t anyone’s fault – we’d just drifted apart. Dina and I have always had a difficult relationship. Dina was probably a bit closer with her father. But she is my daughter and I’m very proud of her. She does get a bit moody whenever I bring anyone over to the house. In three years there have only been a couple of people, but it doesn’t matter to Dina – she shuts down in front of them and can be quite abrupt. The guy who suggested a different wifi provider really annoyed her. Her reaction was almost comical. Half the time Dina’s not here when I invite my partner over. I try to makes sure there is as little overlap as possible In his defence, I’d asked him to come to the house to help me with some DIY, as I needed a hand. But the way Dina acted, you’d think this guy was trying to move in. Now I’m dating someone I really get along with. We go for meals and walks, and sometimes he stays over, just normal stuff. Dina has said she doesn’t mind him being around, but now and again she will make a comment about him encroaching on her space. But it doesn’t happen very often, as I prefer to go to his place. I also don’t think that I need to run every guest visit past my daughter. One time Dina complained about not being able to walk around in her underwear when someone else is around, but I’d prefer it if she didn’t do that anyway. She also has a busy social life herself, so half the time she’s not even here when my partner comes over. I do try to organise it so there is as little overlap as possible. I’ve also suggested we all go out for a meal so she can get to know him properly, but I think she’d rather not. In the meantime, I have to live my life. We all have to try to get along – change is an inevitable part of life.",innocent,high
"Fred earns a lot more than me and should be understanding of my financial position Fred, my older brother, wouldn’t like to call himself tight, but I think he is. He’s also oblivious to the fact that money plays very different roles in our lives. We recently got into a bit of an altercation during a friend’s birthday because of it. Fred invited me to our mutual friend George’s birthday dinner. I said I’d go but that I didn’t have much money. Fred told me not to worry and that he’d cover my share if I was struggling. It was a really nice Korean place and I deliberately didn’t order anything except one starter and one drink, precisely because I’m so low on money. I’m in between jobs as a freelance copywriter and things are really quiet as I’ve lost a few clients. He will offer to lend me money, then retract it when he’s in a different mood When the bill came George said: “Shall we all split it?” I looked at Fred to sort of signal that he had agreed to cover my share. He pretended not to notice. I had to awkwardly point out that I’d only had two things. George said that was fine and that I didn’t have to pay the same as everyone else. But then Fred told me not to be annoying and said I’d also eaten some of the leftover chicken dishes on the table. This was true – but I only did that after it was offered to me. I didn’t appreciate Fred calling me out in front of everyone, and I reminded him that he had said he’d cover my portion, which he flat-out denied. I think he quite enjoys winding me up in front of our mates, but I don’t think it’s funny. Fred is earning good money as a corporate lawyer but he thinks we are all in the same boat. He will offer to lend me money for something – once for a new laptop – then retract the offer when he’s in a different mood. I ended up buying the laptop on finance because he backed out. I joke about it but it’s a bit annoying. Recently we went to Nando’s and he’d forgot his card and couldn’t pay by phone. I paid for our meals and asked him to wire me the £20 or so for his half as soon as he got home. He told me to relax and accused me of being “aggy”, but he doesn’t realise that £20 means a lot more to me than it does to him. I texted him again the next day and he didn’t reply, so I left it because I’m not going to beg. When we went to the pub a month or so afterwards, he bought me a pint as an apology but I would have rather had the cash. He claimed later he had just forgotten to wire me the £20 as he was so busy, but he should be more considerate. I feel at our age – I’m 27 and he’s 30 – Fred should really show a bit more understanding towards people who aren’t in the same pay bracket as him.","Julius prioritises having a lovely time over smart financial decisions. It’s time he listened to me Julius is making me sound like a tight-fisted capitalist pig here. It’s true that I have offered to lend him money once or twice and then reneged on the deal, but there’s been good reason for that. With the meal, I thought it was a bit annoying that he ended up eating nearly as much as everyone else and then didn’t want to split the bill evenly, or looked to me to pay for him. Before I invited him to George’s birthday, he had said that he’d just come along for a drink and I said I’d get him one. But before you know it, he’s ordering various bits and picking at everyone’s food. Then I thought he was showing me up when he asked to pay for just the things he ordered, when he’d actually eaten quite a lot. It probably got my back up so that’s why I said “Let’s just split the bill with the boys”. They are more my mates than his, so I guess I was a bit annoyed at the scene unfolding at the table. If he was genuinely struggling I’d make sure he was fine With this Nando’s thing, he’s making a bigger deal of it than it was. I genuinely forgot and missed his messages because I was slammed at work. I later bought him a drink to make up for it. And I’ve covered him countless times when he’s needed it in the past. I know he’s between work projects at the moment so if he was genuinely struggling with rent or bills I’d make sure he was fine, no questions asked. I’m just a bit stricter when I can see him splurging on things he doesn’t need or if he’s being selfish, like at the birthday dinner. The other time I said I’d lend Julius money was for a laptop. I retracted that offer because he said he was broke but then booked a trip to Ibiza the week after he’d come to me with his begging bowl. You can’t ask to borrow a grand and then go on a big, lavish trip. I know we have different pay brackets but Julius isn’t great with money. He’s always prioritised having a lovely time over making smart financial decisions. I like to have a good time but I guess I’m a bit more sensible. We’re close so I can rib him a bit over his decisions. He doesn’t really listen to me but I think it’s about time he did.",guilty,medium
"I don’t have a problem with dogs, but I am worried about our freedom being curtailed My boyfriend and I can’t decide on which pet, if any, to get. I’m a cat person whereas Jordan is a dog guy. I don’t feel particularly strongly about either, but a cat seems like more of a compromise and less of a big deal. We are both 26 and live in a big European city after leaving London in 2021. After being together for three years Jordan suggested getting a pet. He says it will be “fun”. However, we will probably return to the UK at some point, and I keep thinking of the hassle of travelling with a pet. Jordan says we can cross that bridge when we come to it, he lives for the moment, whereas I like to know what I’m getting myself into. I’m also worried about the expenses: vet bills, pet sitters, food, insurance. Our flat is quite small so I have suggested getting a cat, but Jordan is trying to persuade me otherwise. He says we can get a dog from a shelter as they practically give them away in the country we live in, but that doesn’t draw me in. I’d rather get a pet that’s been properly vaccinated and doesn’t have any issues. Rehoming and adoption isn’t straightforward and shouldn’t be done just to save money. Jordan goes out each weekend and gets up late – I can’t see a dog fitting into his routine I think a cat would be far less work in that department, but Jordan says cats are boring. Neither of us grew up with animals, so we don’t have a lot of experience. I don’t have a problem with dogs per se, but I’m worried about our freedom being curtailed. We both work from home, so we are around to walk it, but we travel a lot. This summer, for example, we’ve been away three times. I just don’t think we’d be able to justify the expense of getting a dog sitter for all our trips. A cat is much easier as you can leave it alone and get neighbours to feed it. Jordan likes to go out each weekend and gets up late, as he works for a US company and his hours are weird. I can’t see a dog fitting into his routine. Until we’re ready, I think no pet is best. Failing that, a cat won’t disrupt our lives too much.","Jada and I work from home and have a flexible routine – a dog won’t change that This idea that I’m not responsible enough to get a dog grates on me a bit. I know I’m ready. I’m also about 20% dog – I’m always active and full of energy. Someone once said I have “big lab energy”. I’d like a big dog, like a labrador or golden retriever. I’d train it, take it for walks and dedicate lots of time to generally loving it, as Jada and I work from home. I think we have a flexible routine right now, so in my opinion, a dog won’t really change that. Jada says a cat would be more realistic, but I find them so dull. They don’t love you like a dog can, and don’t show affection either. You’re either a dog or a cat person, and I’m definitely team dog. I’m actually quite anti-feline – my spirit doesn’t vibe with them. And Jada is OK with either, so we should definitely go with my choice and get a dog. The dog could be my responsibility – Jada won’t have to take care of it She says that if we get a dog, she will end up doing most of the care, but there’s no evidence to support that claim. I keep our flat tidy; I’m not the type of boyfriend who has his partner cleaning up after him. The dog could be my responsibility. I’d be fine with that. I also have better hours than Jada as my clients are US-based, so I’m free for most of the day, until 2pm. I could do the majority of the dog stuff in the day and she could take over for the evening walk. It would be perfect. There’s really nothing left to do except pop along to the local shelter and make ourselves known. I want to adopt, as it would be great to give a dog a home. Jada keeps stalling but I reckon I can persuade her. Once she’s looking into a dog’s pleading eyes, she won’t say no. Obviously there would be challenges around having a dog, but I’m not worried – I’m mentally prepared. The fact we travel a lot doesn’t bother me either. Dog sitters are cheap where we live, so a weekend here or there won’t set us back loads. If we get a cat and go away, we would still have to enlist the help of someone else and probably pay for that, so we might as well just commit to a dog. That’s a proper pet in my eyes.",guilty,high
"David claims his mother never made a big fuss of closing the toilet lid but I think it’s of paramount importance My partner Michelle’s son, David, is a good kid. I’ve known him for the past six years while dating his mum, but since moving into her home a year ago I’ve noticed a few little differences between the way I raised my children, and the way she has raised hers. The main one is the fact that David doesn’t put the lid down after he goes to the toilet. As men, we should put the toilet seat down after we go for a whiz, and I’ve always done that. But I was also taught that we should close the toilet lid completely when we go for a No 2. If you flush with the lid up it releases something called an ‘aerosol plume’, a cloud of germs In general I always put the toilet down when I flush – seat and lid. This is to avoid germs spraying up into the bathroom and going everywhere. If you flush with the lid up it releases something called an “aerosol plume”, a cloud of germs, basically. Obviously there’s more bacteria when you go for a No 2. David isn’t from that school of thought. He’s 18 and still living at home while he finishes college. He claims Michelle never made a big fuss of closing the toilet lid but I think it’s of paramount importance. I read a study once that said toothbrushes kept in bathrooms where people don’t close their toilet lid have a lot more bacteria than those in bathrooms where people do. Michelle says it doesn’t really matter to her, but when I moved in, the first thing I did was move all the family toothbrushes to the bathroom cabinet as they were resting on a shelf directly next to the loo. David then moved his back to the usual spot. I said “There’s no need for that: it’s more hygienic in the cupboard” but he just shrugged and l left it. My two boys are grown up – 21 and 27 – and now live with their mum. But in the past, when we lived together in my house, they agreed with my views on bathroom etiquette. I can’t really dictate to Michelle how to raise David, but I have gently nudged David to close the lid of the toilet seat after he uses it. I don’t like to tell him how to behave too much; that’s down to Michelle. I’d just like to see David try to listen to me when it comes to this as I’m trying to help, that’s all.","Ray’s overreacting about a so-called ‘plume’ that’s never caused problems – and my mum agrees Flushing the loo and putting the seat down afterwards isn’t a problem for me, but remembering to close the whole lid is. One time Ray came into the bathroom after me and told me that the lid of the toilet should have been closed and I got a bit triggered. I thought: why are you coming in here sniffing the air, examining the toilet and trying to catch me out? It’s a bit weird. Ray has told me a few times to close the lid to prevent bacteria spraying around the room, but I don’t think it’s registering. My mum never drilled that one into us growing up, and it’s probably too late now. My defence is that I just don’t believe that the germs spray up into the atmosphere. Or if they do, I don’t think they are going to kill us, or impact us in any serious way. When Ray moved in he was pretty chilled at first, but he’s gradually got a bit more outspoken as he’s grown more comfortable. I don’t mind him, and we have a good relationship. He’s been good to Mum since my dad left us 10 years ago, but obviously there’s some things I had to adjust to. Now I have to share the front room with him so he can watch his detective shows. I don’t believe that the germs spray up into the atmosphere. Or if they do, they aren’t going to kill us Ray never tries to tell me what to do, but he offers his opinion up quite a lot. He says things like: “I’m just going to suggest this …” or “Back in my day”. After a long time without my dad in the house, it can be difficult to consider someone else. I like Ray, but sometimes it’ll feel like two against one when Mum takes his side. With the toilet-lid issue, Mum actually takes my side, which proves that I’m in the right. She even said to Ray that since we don’t care about the toilet-seat thing, he doesn’t need to move our stuff around, but he said it was for our own health. We both thought it was a bit over the top, moving the toothbrushes. I actually told him: “No one cares”, but he went off on one about bacteria. The toothbrushes have stayed in the cabinet, which is fine, but now that they are in there, I am probably even more lax about closing the toilet lid. If we’ve locked them away then why do we need to stress?",innocent,medium
"River and Sky ignore me when I try to make plans, but reply in 0.2 seconds when I share a meme I’m in an Instagram chat group with my brothers, River and Sky, and I always feel left out. The boys communicate almost exclusively in memes, and I am constantly ignored. I’m 27, River is 31 and Sky is 24. If I try to make plans with them, they will leave me hanging but still reply to each other in memes. I also have an issue with the type of memes they send. Some of them are sexual in tone: jokes about women and one-night stands. They are a bit laddy. I’m in the chat thinking, “Oh, OK – this is how my brothers communicate … this is what they find amusing.” I’m happy to be in the chat and I don’t want to be a negative Nelly, so I don’t bring up my issues with the memes they send, but it’s really not my thing. I am outnumbered as the only woman. Also, I’ve only just been added to the sibling chat. If I try to have a serious conversation I get ignored. River told me Instagram is not the place for that River and I don’t live at home any more, but I discovered that he and Sky had their own chat, without me, when we were at our dad’s during lockdown. They were laughing across the living room on their phones at a skateboarding meme River had sent Sky. I said: “Hey, I like memes!” and they replied: “Fine, we will add you to the chat.” I’ve earned my place, but it does feel like it might be under threat if I don’t post the right type of memes. One time I sent one about being a woman on dating apps and it got zero likes. Obviously they couldn’t relate to it, but blanking me was a bit harsh. If I try to have a serious conversation in the chat I get ignored. River told me Instagram is not the place for that and I have to call him if I want to make plans, but that’s annoying. Why should I have to call him separately? There have been plenty of times when my brothers have ignored my messages when I’m trying to make a plan, but then I’ve posted a meme and they’ve replied to that in 0.2 seconds. The boys need to start using the Instagram group chat for actual conversation as well as memes. And I’d like my type of meme humour to be respected, too.","The group is for meme chat. If Chante wants to make arrangements, she should use WhatsApp The first rule of the meme chat is that you don’t talk about the meme chat. Chante is making a bigger deal of this than she needs to. She’s quite sensitive, so if we don’t reply she gets annoyed. The thing is that Sky and I made this chat group specifically to send memes. It’s Instagram, not WhatsApp. Chante says we need to reply to her messages on there, that it’s irritating if we’ve replied to everything else on the chat except her comments. But Instagram isn’t the place for making plans: it’s for sliding into DMs and also sharing memes and vidoes. We can talk on WhatsApp (although we don’t have a sibling group on there) or we can call each other, but Chante doesn’t get that. She takes it personally if she’s typed something and I don’t respond to it, but carry on sharing memes. But sometimes I just don’t see her messages, as they get buried among all the memes and videos. Also, my brain is just not wired to look out for words on the chat, because when I open it the only thing I want to do is laugh, not worry about being serious and making plans. We made the group during lockdown and it’s helped us stay a bit more connected as a family. Instagram isn’t the place for making plans - it’s for sliding into DMs and sharing memes In relation to the content we send each other, Sky and I are guys, so we do have a slightly different sense of humour from Chante, but we aren’t into anything dark or horrible. It’s just some of the videos are below-the-belt sort of banter, and I know Chante doesn’t like that. But that’s just how it is. Sometimes she sends funny stuff, too. We have a family joke about Sky hating jam because when he was little he bit into a sandwich thinking it was ketchup and cried loads when he realised it was sweet. Chante found a really cute reaction video of a baby trying jam for the first time and said it was like Sky. We all liked it, so it’s not like we blank Chante all the time. She just needs to realise what the group is actually for, and stop forcing us to chat where there doesn’t need to be chat. WhatsApp is for real communication and Instagram is for memes.",innocent,high
"It’s disgusting to see tampons floating in the loo, and our sewers can’t handle them Maura and I have lived together for three years. We are housemates and best friends, but she flushes her tampons down the loo and it frustrates me. Occasionally they don’t flush and I see them when I use the bathroom. Maura is apologetic when they don’t flush, but also says I shouldn’t tell her whether or not to flush her tampons. Other women I know are mainly on my side about this, but when the subject has been discussed in front of Maura and her two sisters, they say: “No womb, no say.” This has been going on for the whole three years we’ve lived together, and Maura doesn’t budge or admit she’s in the wrong. She won’t stop doing it. It’s a bit disgusting to look at when they are in the toilet. When I see them I joke to her: “Guess what I’ve found floating in the loo?” The heart of my prosecution concerns the environment. When it rains, raw sewage can overflow into the river I think: why not wrap them up and put them in the bin, as that’s how I’m told most women deal with them. But Maura thinks that’s more unhygienic. The heart of my prosecution, though, actually concerns the environment. Our old Victorian sewers can’t handle tampons. I also go swimming in the river, and, when it rains, raw sewage can overflow into it. The thought of swimming beside a load of tampons is gross. In general, Maura is the tidy one and does more of the cleaning. I am super aware about that gender disparity and that makes me less inclined to pull her up on this, as usually I am the one being pulled up for my habits. As a man, who doesn’t get periods, I sometimes wonder if Maura has a point about the tampons, given all the housework she does. When I asked Maura about giving readers their say on this matter, she asked about the anonymity of the piece. This suggests to me that she knows she is guilty but doesn’t care enough to change. I’m hoping everyone will agree with me on this. I don’t have a problem with seeing tampons in general, and believe that they should be more normalised in society – I just don’t need to see them floating in the toilet.","It’s my job to take the bins out – and handling used tampons makes me feel sick Jeremiah and I have been friends for nine years and have lived together for the last three. I’d say we are best friends. We get on really well as housemates, but when it comes to the tampons I agree with my sisters when they say: “No womb, no say.” He doesn’t understand what it’s like to have a period, so I don’t really want to debate this issue with him in the first place. However, my main point of defence is that I would never deliberately leave tampons in the loo, but the flush in our toilet isn’t great, so sometimes it just happens. Jeremiah likes to dance around and shout whenever he finds a tampon floating in our loo. It’s become this debate because he’s made it into a big deal. It is always my job to take the bins out, so I’m less keen on leaving tampons in the bin The first time he brought it up was in front of my sisters. I reckon that Jeremiah thought they were going to take his side, but in fact they didn’t because they are fiercely loyal to me. I do have a bit of an issue with Jeremiah taking the piss out of me about all this because I already feel shame and embarrassment. His jokes just add to the fuss of having a period. I think that looking at used tampons is gross, so I feel even more embarrassed when Jeremiah sees mine floating in the loo. I also have an issue with Jeremiah’s complaints because I do way more of the housework than he does, which he admits. I like to keep things clean, whereas he’s just not as on it. It is always my job to take the bins out, so I’m less keen on leaving tampons in the bin as this makes me feel a bit sick. I would much rather flush them away than have to see them again. On the issue of toilet waste leading to fatbergs in the sewers, I agree that it is really bad. But since Jeremiah has never had a period, can he really say much on this? I have also told him before that I make sure to buy organic, compostable tampons, as these are much better for the environment. I don’t want to stop flushing my tampons away, and think Jeremiah should not bring it up every time he sees one.",guilty,high
"Penelope should rinse the teaspoon after she makes her coffee, but she says this is too much effort My wife, Penelope, drinks mainly coffee while I drink mainly tea. We make drinks for each other when working from home, but Penelope uses the same teaspoon she makes her instant coffee with for my tea. She swirls the coffee around in her cup and then takes my teabag out with the same spoon, with coffee granules stuck on the end. After she squeezes the teabag against the side of the cup and stirs it with the spoon, my tea tastes like instant coffee. It’s annoying, as I hate the taste. I see tea as a weaker and more delicate drink than instant coffee, so it’s not fair to mix the flavours, especially this way round. Penelope says I can’t possibly taste the coffee, but of course I can. Even I get the teaspoons mixed up sometimes because the teaspoon we use stays on the cork mat beside the kettle all day. It ruins my drinks. I see tea as a weaker and more delicate drink than instant coffee, so it’s not fair to mix the flavours I’ve asked Penelope to toss the spoon in the sink or take a new one out for me after she makes a coffee, but she never does. I will walk innocently into the kitchen and see this teaspoon lying down in wait, like a trap. We agree that space is scarce so we don’t want to use lots of different teaspoons. It’s a frivolous problem, but it affects my tea each day. The solution is for Penelope to rinse the teaspoon after making her coffee, but she says this is too much effort. This whole thing is a lockdown hangover, because we are both home more now – and often work from home at the same time. We have been living together for a decade but I only really noticed the spoon thing during lockdown, and now I can’t unsee it. Penelope is more house proud than me but less “on it’” when it comes to being tidy in general. A conflict-free solution might involve us both just having coffee from the cafetiere, but I can’t drink that all day. I don’t have a tea support group I can talk to about this issue, so I hope the readers will agree with me. I just want my tea to taste pure.","Washing the spoon under the tap is an extra step. Why bother if he can’t taste the coffee? I don’t think the way I make Ellis’s tea is a big issue at all. We have one teaspoon by the kettle which is used for both tea and coffee, and I will admit that I use the same spoon for both. I don’t believe you can taste the difference. I don’t want to have 1,500 teaspoons that have only been used once all over the house, so I reuse the same spoon. I think the only reason Ellis has an issue with this now is because he has seen me reusing it – but if he hadn’t seen it, I don’t believe he would know. The taste is simply not strong enough. I do wash the coffee granules off the spoon by swirling it around my own mug before placing the spoon in Ellis’s mug I work in the kitchen so I do make Ellis slightly more cups than he makes me, although we do generally share all housework and chores evenly. Since Ellis has pointed out his teaspoon issue, I do wash the coffee granules off the spoon by swirling it around my own mug before placing the spoon in Ellis’s mug, but Ellis says that’s not real cleaning. I think it’s fine: the instant coffee residue is washed off the spoon before it is used to take the teabag out. Ellis also drinks Earl Grey, which has a strong flavour anyway. Washing the spoon off under the tap is an extra step, and if I don’t believe he can taste it, why bother? We met in 2009 and have been married for seven years. This debate is the extent of our marital problems but it does come up often now, as we are making more teas and coffees for each other since we both started hybrid working after lockdown. I would love for Ellis to drink more coffee, then we wouldn’t have this debate. I had a colleague who used to make teas and coffees for the office and would lick the spoon in between stirring, so at least I’m not doing that. I think I will do a taste test for Ellis. I’ll make him multiple cups of tea, with only one that has been stirred with a coffee-stained spoon. He can then try and guess which one it is. That’s the only way we can prove if Ellis really tastes the difference. I still think he won’t be able to.",guilty,high
"Natalie turns into a slob the minute Mum and Dad go on holiday. I come home to flies buzzing around in the kitchen My younger sister, Natalie, is a sneaky one. When she’s at home with Mum and Dad she’s very tidy, but when it’s just us in the house her true self comes out. Natalie is 19 and is in a part-time apprenticeship, while I am 25 and work full-time, as do my parents. They are both teachers and get more time off than Natalie and me, so they often go on holiday for weeks at a time and leave us at home. My mum says that in their absence I need to look after Natalie and keep the house tidy, but once they’re out the door I have little to no jurisdiction over my sister. Freed from their watchful eyes, she turns into a slob. She forgets to wipe down surfaces after cooking breakfast, and leaves unwashed pans out all day Mum can be quite strict, so maybe Natalie sees their holidays as a chance to have some time off, but I find it hard to manage. It is mainly a kitchen problem. Natalie will let plates pile up for days without rinsing the food off. We have a dishwasher but she is too lazy to stack it. I’ll come home from work and there will be flies buzzing around. It’s not nice. She forgets to wipe down surfaces after cooking breakfast, and has left unwashed pans out all day. If I tell her off she says: “You can’t tell me what to do”, and leaves the kitchen in a huff. She also gets annoyed if I do a food shop without running everything past her, but I just want to get it done. She refuses to help out with things like taking out the bins, too, saying it’s a “man’s job” – and that I should do it when Dad isn’t home. I think she just likes to make excuses. I have told my parents what she is like when they’re not around, but Dad doesn’t believe me because Natalie is a daddy’s girl, and Mum simply tells Natalie to ensure the house is tidy before she returns, which it always is. Annoyingly, Natalie always makes sure everything is cleaned up about 30 minutes before they walk through the door. If I complain in front of them, she denies it was ever messy. I sometimes feel like I’m being gaslit.","When our parents are away, I like to live the way I want. And I always clean everything up before they get back My parents go away a lot during their school holidays and I definitely like having a free house. Although it’s not really free because my brother, Matt, is around. He has got two modes: super relaxed and barely around because he’s working or with his friends, or negative and moody because he’s hungover and stressed. There is no middle ground with him. Last summer my parents went to Asia for two weeks and Matt was insufferable. He would come back from work and moan if there were a few crumbs on the counter or a plate in the sink. I was home more often last year because my apprenticeship was fewer hours, so it was natural that I created a bit more mess. But it’s not as bad as Matt makes out – I just prefer to let things build up and tidy it all up at the end. I leave pots and pans to soak for a few days before washing them. Our parents would tell me off for that, but when they are away I like to live the way I want. I stand by the fact that taking the bins out is a man’s job Matt isn’t even that tidy, but when our parents aren’t around I think he feels as if he has a bit of power over me. But if that’s the case, he should use it properly. Our parents leave us a budget for food, but he never asks me what I want when he does the shopping – he just gets the usual stuff and all the things he likes. That’s pretty annoying. He should take me into consideration if he wants me to do the same for him. And I stand by the fact that taking the bins out is a man’s job, and Dad agrees. When he got home after one holiday he told Matt to step up to the task. Girls don’t take bins out: that’s just a fact. This summer our parents are going to South America for three weeks, I’m off to Spain, and Matt’s going to Croatia. There will be 10 days when Matt and I will be in the house alone together. Because he grassed me up to our parents last time, I’ve decided to make a little more effort to keep the kitchen clean. But only a little. He needs to take a chill pill.",guilty,high
"Nathan should save up to go to a salon instead of using our bathroom like it’s his boudoir My son, Nathan, has just moved back home after university and he’s at that stage where he’s experimenting with his hair. He is always messing around with hair dyes in our bathroom and it’s making a right mess. I wouldn’t mind if we lived in a mansion and he had his own bathroom, but the rest of us have to use the sink after he’s spilled green, black or blond dye all over it. It’s inconsiderate as I end up doing most of the cleaning up. I’m always telling him: “Nathan, don’t you dare dye your hair again without wiping the bathroom down after you,” and he will say, “Yeah, yeah, Mum”, but there’s always splodges of something on the mirror or the shower or the taps. I think he’s got worse since being at university because his father and I weren’t able to tell him off He’s always been a messy boy. After showering he leaves pools of water on the floor and he never wipes down the shower. If he’s shaved there will be hairs all over the sink, too. I think he’s actually got worse since university because his father and I weren’t around to tell him off. He’s a law unto himself. Nathan came out as gay four years ago, which his father and I totally support. Around the same time, he started experimenting with his clothes and hair. I don’t mind that, of course – I want him to feel totally comfortable with who he is. I’d just rather he saved up to go to a salon instead of turning our bathroom into a boudoir. I paid for him to have his hair done once for his birthday, but three months later he was plastering pink dye over it to create a new style, which was annoying. Nathan’s had a few outlandish styles in his 21 years. He once had his head shaved, with half of it dyed green and the other half dyed blond. Admittedly, that wasn’t my favourite look, but it’s not my hair. To me he looked like a skinhead from back in my day. If Nathan can’t save up to go to a salon, then he should stop dyeing his hair at home altogether. I’m loath to ban his self-expression entirely, but a bit more care would be appreciated.","Mum will always find a speck of dye somewhere – but this is really about her not liking my hairstyles My mum has never liked me highlighting my hair. When I dyed it green and blond she kicked up a big fuss and said that I looked like a “punk”. I told her, “That was the intention, hun.” I think she feigns concern about the cleanliness of the bathroom, but this is really about the fact she doesn’t like me experimenting with bright looks. She’s always been quite conservative and even though she says it’s fine, I suspect some of her complaints are really about wanting to control me a bit. I dress in bright colours, with lots of silver studded belts and different patterned trousers. Mum doesn’t tell me that she doesn’t like my style, but I get that impression. She says stuff like, “Oh, that’s a lot of colour, love.” I get along with both my parents, but Dad is definitely more chilled. He’ll defend me if I leave a bit of hair dye on the bathroom floor, whereas Mum can kick off. She says it’s because she’s asked me to be careful, and that I’m deliberately messy, but that’s not the case. I try to keep the dye in the shower and I wipe things down after me – but she will always find a speck of something somewhere. If Mum hates me doing DIY dyeing she could set up a hair fund to ensure her poor struggling son continues to slay It’s more of an affront if the dye is black and it’s on the floor, because we have white tiles. I asked her to pay for me to go to a salon if she’s so bothered, kind of as a half-joke, but also to see if she would. She didn’t like that one. She said I was spoilt. But Mum has only treated me to some highlights once, for my 21st last year, so I’m not spoilt. I’d pay to get my hair done professionally if I had more money, but at the moment I’m interning, so that’s not really possible. If Mum hates me doing DIY dyeing she could set up a hair fund to ensure her poor struggling son continues to slay. I came out a few years ago, and thankfully my parents were very supportive. They think my hair dyeing is just a phase, but I can’t see this changing any time soon. I can try to be extra diligent when I’m dyeing my hair, but until I’m making shedloads of cash – or my parents enforce an outright ban – I’m not going to stop doing it at home.",guilty,high
"It’s just embarrassing walking around in the same outfit. It feels like we’re back at school Aleesha and I have been friends since we were 11. I would say that out of the two of us, she is more of a wind-up merchant. She likes to be antagonistic and contrary for the sake of it, and thinks it’s hilarious if we go to a party in the same dress or jacket, whereas I find it cringe and weird. I just don’t get the whole idea of dressing like your mates. It was a lot worse when we were younger. I’d choose a top or something I liked when we were out shopping, and Aleesha would say, “That’s so nice”, and buy the same one. When we were 16, we fell out over something like that. It doesn’t happen as much any more, but on big occasions, like a party, festival or friend’s wedding, she’ll come up to me and say, “Love your dress. Gonna have to buy the same one now!” She knows how much it winds me up. Case in point: Glastonbury last year, when she pulled out the same zebra-print jacket as me. I don’t know why she does it. It’s just embarrassing walking around in the same outfit. I like to be different, I like to feel my choices and fashion sense are my own. One part of my brain is like – I chose this look first and I don’t want to share my style with anyone After I bought it, I’d told her about it on a call, then she went and got the same outfit behind my back without telling me. Is that not strange? I don’t like feeling as if we are back at school. Antonia, a friend of ours, then started adding fuel to the fire by saying, “Oh, now what are you two going to do? People will get you confused.” They were winding me up and it took about 15 minutes for me to see that I probably was reacting unreasonably. But I’d spent weeks planning my outfits and the thought of Aleesha piggy-backing off my well-laid plans just irked me. I’m trying to be a bit less dramatic about things like this because the logical part of my brain realises that there is no point trying to control what your friends wear. But then the other part of me thinks: I chose this look first and I don’t want to share my style with anyone. Aleesha should just get her own fashion sense, that would help us avoid this scenario for ever.","Our dress sense has become more similar. It’s no wonder we buy some of the same items Ella is amazing. She’s kind, generous and hilarious – the life and soul of any party. But whenever I buy an item of clothing that resembles hers, she reverts to the same childlike behaviour from our school days. Our friend Antonia thinks it’s hilarious. I find it mildly amusing, but also think she’s in the wrong. Before Glastonbury last year, I’d been talking to Ella about outfits and she had shown me this cool zebra-print jacket on Zoom. I went and bought the same jacket on Depop. I didn’t think anything of it until I pulled the jacket out at Glasto and said, “Look what I’ve got, we can be matching!” Ella flipped and said, “No, that’s not cool. I don’t want to look the same as you. Why did you buy it?” I was shocked. I pointed out it was a festival and that the zebra-print jacket was mass produced: anyone can buy one. We are in our 30s now, so I’m not sure why it still bothers her. I put it down to a funny quirk Our dress sense has become more similar as we’ve grown up. Ella used to be preppy and wear classic stuff like plain designer shirts and oversized bags; now she’s more eclectic. I’d like to think she takes a bit of inspiration from me, as I’ve always been drawn to colours and prints. Ella used to rip me for it; now she’s come around, so it’s no wonder we buy the same items. Related: You be the judge: should my fiance start drying his hands properly instead of letting them drip dry? Ella and I don’t live in the same city any more, so it’s not like we’re going to be running into each other wearing matching outfits every day. Once we happened to be in similar flared trousers. Antonia pointed it out, saying, “Uh-oh, you’re matching again.” It was funny to see a flicker of panic across Ella’s face. Ella’s always been a bit like this. At school she wouldn’t tell me the name of her perfume because she didn’t want me to wear it. I thought that was funny. Maybe she likes to feel unique. We’re in our 30s now, so I’m not sure why it still bothers her. I still love her dearly – I just put it down to a quirk she has. It would just be good to think that, if we accidentally end up in a similar outfit in future, she would be able to keep her cool. It’s not that big a deal. If anything, it just speaks to our incredible mutual fashion sense.",guilty,high
"All the details are finalised, after three years of planning – then Akane asks at the last minute I’m getting married to my fiance, Martin, next month and have pretty much arranged everything – it’s been three years in the works. Like most brides, I am already stressed about the details – and now my cousin Akane is adding in some last-minute dietary requirements. I’m already worried about things like amending bridesmaids’ dresses and the speeches – and, as usual, Martin is leaving it all up to me. We are lucky that we’ve got family to help with the cost, and have well-paid jobs. Most of the details were finalised months ago, but now Akane wants me to change our food options because she’s gone gluten-free. Akane says she’s developed a gluten intolerance and that she needs to have a different main and dessert, but I don’t believe her. How can you just develop an intolerance like that overnight? Akane and I are Japanese, whereas Martin is from the UK, so we are having a wedding with Japanese food, plus some British options. I’ve always lived in the UK and don’t really know many people who are coeliacs. It’s a running joke in our family that Akane is all or nothing with diet fads. I don’t believe she really needs this I reckon it’s just another diet fad for Akane. We grew up together and are only a couple of years apart in age – our mums are sisters. We used to eat noodles with our family – Akane didn’t have an issue with gluten back then. It’s a running joke in our family that she’s all or nothing with fads. One year she went on a keto diet and lost loads of weight. I wouldn’t mind too much if Akane had asked for gluten-free options when we sent the invitations out, but the caterers have already designed the final menu and we’ve paid. No one else on the guest list is gluten-free, so it wasn’t a consideration. Japanese cooking has lots of soy and flour, and the company says it’s going to cost extra to provide alternatives. Because I don’t believe Akane really needs this – as far as I know she hasn’t even taken the coeliac test – I’ve said she may have to skip a few courses. Alternatively, for this one evening she can eat the food I’ve chosen – surely that won’t kill her?","I’m not asking for my own specially created menu – just something I can nibble on I’m sorry to say it, but I think Tameka is being a bit of a bridezilla. I have requested some gluten-free alternatives and I don’t think that’s too much to ask for – it’s a normal thing at a wedding. Tameka has chosen noodles, fish and other items in panko breadcrumbs and batter, which I used to love, but I can’t eat any more. She has said it’s going to cost extra to design a gluten-free menu, but I am not asking for my own specially created version of everything. I’m just wondering if it would be possible to give me something else to nibble on. Because she remembers me eating gluten when we were growing up, I don’t think Tameka takes my dietary requirements seriously. But I’m now more health conscious. I was having a lot of digestive issues and noticed that they all went away when I stopped consuming gluten about six months ago. I didn’t do a test, but I don’t need to. My mother and a lot of people in my family, including Tameka, don’t really get it. Asian diets are traditionally very high in gluten, and when I went back to Japan this year I noticed that there was a real resistance to coeliac foods. But here in the UK it’s a lot easier to get the kind of foods we need. When I got married my priority was making sure everyone felt comfortable, and the food options worked for all my guests Tameka is making it sound like such a huge deal. She said, “Just eat the raw fish and leave the noodles. There’s rice on the menu so you won’t go hungry.” But that’s not the point; it’s about being accommodating. I also think Tameka isn’t treating me like other guests because we are cousins. If I were a relative travelling over from Japan, or one of her lawyer colleagues, I’m sure she would make the changes. Annoyingly, I’m going to the wedding with my husband and he says it’s too last-minute to expect a whole new menu to be drawn up just for me. When I got married a few years ago, my priority was making sure everyone felt comfortable, and that meant checking the seating and food options worked for all my guests. Tameka needs to realise what this day is about – celebrating with friends and family.",guilty,medium
"It’s just laziness – there are plenty of towels. It’s also ruining our floor My fiance, Jasper, is averse to using tea towels and hand towels. After he washes his hands in the kitchen, he never dries them. It might seem like a small thing, but when we’re both cooking and catching up after work, we are practically stepping in puddles. It’s dangerous and annoying. When I came in from work the other night I noticed all this water on the floor. I mopped it up as Jasper was cooking and said: “I’m just going to wipe this up silently as it makes me feel better.” Jasper laughed and we carried on chatting. But then 10 seconds later I saw what seemed like three times the amount of water on the floor because Jasper had washed his hands without drying them and then walked across the kitchen again. I just said: “Hell, no!” Sometimes he will hug me with wet hands and literally wipe the water on my back. He thinks it’s funny Jasper protested and said it wasn’t a big deal, but I don’t know how he does it. I tell him to dry his hands on the tea towel, a paper towel or the bathroom towel in our loo next door. He claims that I forbade him from using tea towels but that’s not true. I’d rather him do that than no towel at all. We live in a Victorian conversion flat with natural hardwood floors: moisture is their worst nightmare. Our floors are actually getting damaged because Jasper is too lazy to find a towel. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes Sometimes he will hug me with wet hands and literally wipe the water on my back. He thinks it’s funny but I don’t understand why he wouldn’t just walk to the bathroom and dry his hands there. It would take him five seconds. There’s no excuse. Life with me is pretty chill – I’m fair, communicate well, and make sure Jasper and I have a good life together. But I’m also a control freak, and now I’m organising the bulk of our wedding. It’s a lot of planning, so when I’m home I want to truly relax – but I can’t do that if the flat is a mess. We’ve lived together for seven years and are used to each other’s habits, but I’m currently more aware of little things annoying me because I’m under extra pressure. Jasper needs to be more diligent so that we can live in peace together. I wouldn’t want anything to jeopardise our chances of walking down the aisle together later this year.","I’m often hard at work in the kitchen – and tea towels are off-limits Me sprinkling a bit of water on the floor is not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. So I drag some water across the kitchen after I wash up because there’s no towel nearby – sue me! You’d think I’d need to wear swimming trunks in the kitchen the way Persephone goes on. The other day she came home from work and was completely consumed by the fact there were a few drops of water on the floor. I was actually cooking and didn’t have time to find a tea towel after washing my hands. Persephone said I was lazy and making a mess and ruining the floors, and she kicked off for about 15 minutes. I thought that was a bit over the top. The neighbours must have thought the wedding was off from the way she was going on. Surely I should be let off if I’m hard at work in the kitchen when it happens? Persephone also says I deliberately wipe my hands on her, which isn’t true. But even if I did, it’s only a drop of water, so what’s the big deal? When she accused me of doing that before, I defended myself by saying that I just couldn’t keep my hands off her and needed to give her a hug the second I saw her, and forgot to dry my hands in the process. She didn’t believe me. We’ve been together for 11 years so we know how to push each other’s buttons. Persephone has always been a bit more highly strung than me, but this water thing has got considerably worse in recent years, and I’m not sure why. I do my fair share of the cooking and cleaning in the kitchen, but Persephone loves to make out that I’m a slob. Surely I should be let off if I’m hard at work in the kitchen when it happens? Related: You be the judge: should my friend stop nicking my seat in my favourite cafe? I don’t do it deliberately to annoy her – it’s more of an unconscious thing. I don’t use the tea towels because I get told off for doing so. If I do use one, Persephone says it’s for drying dishes, not my hands. If I just let my hands drip dry, she tells me off for making a mess. What’s a man to do? I think that we need to get a hand towel in the kitchen but since it’s so small, there’s not really any room for one. I also just think that Persephone needs to relax a bit more and not let little things like this get to her.",guilty,high
"Nothing I do at the gym is good enough for my fitness-fanatic girlfriend and it’s making me feel inadequate My girlfriend, Jenny, and I go to the gym together, and she’s constantly judging me while I’m working out. She moans at me and says: “All you do is go on your phone.” But I’m doing light exercises and chill workouts, whereas she goes hard every time with her high-interval training. I’m not sure what her problem is; it’s not like I’m making her run slower by being on my phone. She often has a go at me and questions why I go with her. I say: “At least I’m bloody here.” We go five times a week, though if it was up to me I’d probably only go twice. I don’t push hard every time, but I think that’s normal – and I can’t believe that me going five times a week isn’t good enough for Jenny. She makes out that I’m lazy. She will wake up early, do yoga, go for a run and then go to the gym – it’s unreal Guys, including bodybuilders, come up to me in the gym and say: “Your girlfriend motivates me to go harder.” She loves that. Sometimes I try to join in with Jenny’s hardcore workouts, but she never praises me when I do. When I work out in a more chilled way, or I’m on my phone, she’ll come over and drop a snarky one-liner like, “Ha! Classic!”, then walk off. I find that triggering and we’ve had fights in the gym before. I hate it when she comes up behind me and watches what I’m doing on my phone, before making a comment. It’s like she’s spying. The gym should be a place for me to unwind, too. Jenny prioritises the gym over everything. We’ve been together for a year and she’s always been like this. She will wake up early, do yoga, go for a run, then go to the gym. It’s unreal. She wants a fitness-fanatic girlfriend, and I feel inadequate next to her at times. I’ll suggest going to grab a coffee or meeting people in the pub and she’ll make excuses, like “I don’t feel well.” I’ll reply: “Oh, so no gym then?” But she’ll still go. She needs to change tack or I’ll stop going.","I like to be in and out in an hour, but Janae wastes so much time I love going to the gym, but since I’ve been with Janae I’ve made sacrifices when it comes to how I work out. The gym is my happy place, somewhere I can just put headphones in and be stress-free. Working out makes me feel better about myself. Janae also goes to the gym, but not in the same way as me. She comes to the gym to gossip with her friends, or waste time watching videos on her phone. I used to go to the gym at 7am, but Janae wants to go in the middle of the day or late at night. I prefer to get my exercise out of the way, and to relax in the evenings. Janae prefers to wake up late, have a coffee and go to the gym at 2pm. I think that is wasting the whole day, but I’m in a relationship with her so I compromise. It’s not just me who thinks that Janae’s behaviour is ridiculous. She is known for wasting time Sometimes, before we head out, Janae will say she doesn’t want to go, and I have to motivate her into getting there. I find that annoying. And when we get to the gym, Janae is often on her phone the whole time. I’ll offer to work out with her, but she’ll say she wants to do her own thing. But I’ll look over later and she’s not doing much. I like to be in and out of the gym in an hour, but Janae wants to stay for two hours. I’ll be ready to leave and she’ll say: “Oh, can we stay longer, I haven’t worked out that much.” I’ll say: “Of course you haven’t, that’s because you’ve been scrolling on your phone.” It’s not just me who thinks that Janae’s behaviour is ridiculous. She is known for wasting time. The personal trainers at the gym recognise us and often come over and ask: “Are you actually going to do anything today?” Janae needs to get serious when she’s with me. We are both fit, healthy and toned. I am slightly obsessed with the gym – I just think that if you’re there you may as well be fully there and workout, rather than doing nothing. Why waste your time?",guilty,high
"Our bed is full of scratchy crumbs. I issued a food ban years ago but Harriet completely ignores it My partner Harriet and I have been living together for six years, and the one thing that’s not changed during that time is her bed-eating habits. I can’t deal with crumbs in the bed. I have had a ban on food in the bedroom for as long as I can remember, but she just ignores it. I hate getting into bed and feeling as if I’m lying on sandpaper. The crumbs are scratchy against my legs. Harriet will deny eating in bed until the cows come home, but I can feel bits of crisps and breadcrumbs on me. It drives me mad. Sometimes, I will make us get out of bed and vacuum the sheets, or brush the crumbs out by beating the sheets with a cushion. It’s not a very relaxing routine when you’re meant to be winding down. Often, Harriet thinks the whole thing is funny; other times she calls me paranoid. When I try to tell her off, she says ‘I’m not being constrained by your patriarchal norms,’ and claims I’m trying to control her I think the idea of eating in bed is bad for you, in a psychological sense. Harriet will stay in bed all day “working”, but I don’t think she does as much as she could. Lying down, surrounded by packets of food is gross and doesn’t set you up for a solid day of work. I prefer to go to a co-working space as I think it’s important to put some distance between home and work. It’s especially important to create a space between sleeping and working, but if you work in bed all day that’s impossible. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes When I try to tell her off, she says “I’m not being constrained by your patriarchal norms,” and claims I’m trying to control her. It has nothing to do with the patriarchy; I’d just like the bed we share to be clean and crumb-free. That’s not too much to ask, is it? Harriet also says that because she is the one doing most of the cleaning in our flat she can make whatever mess she wants, but that is ridiculous. We live together and need to make an effort to be clean for each other, otherwise we’ll end up justifying any type of bad behaviour.","Food tastes better in bed. But I also keep it clean – Hugo is just imagining the crumbs on the sheets I eat everything in bed – and I usually hide the evidence pretty well. One time, I chucked the wrapper of some gluten-free biscuits down the side of the bed – Hugo was not happy when he found it. I work from home all day as a freelance writer, whereas Hugo uses co-working spaces for his social marketing job. Sometimes I’ll eat a whole meal in bed. I make sure I take the plate downstairs so Hugo doesn’t know, but afterwards the room can smell of food so I get caught out. It’s hard not to spill things in bed, but I’ve perfected the art of propping a hard pillow behind me and balancing my plate of goodies on another cushion in front of me. I just tuck my chin in a lot when I eat. Food just tastes better in bed. When you look at dogs in the wild, or even in a house, when you give them a delicious piece of food, they retreat to their bed to eat it, which has a lot to do with feeling safe and comfortable. I’m like a dog in that sense. I have tried to eat less in bed recently, but it doesn’t seem to make a difference to how much I get accused The sort of person who eats in bed is also the sort of person who can’t be bothered to go to the shop. That’s me. I’ll just raid the cupboards and see what’s there. I’m partial to rice cakes, crisps and whatever snacks we have lying around, but these are quite crumby. I’ve also been known to eat a Domino’s pizza in bed, which is deliciously naughty. That is usually saved for when Hugo is out, as I know I’ll get mega-told-off for that. I have tried to eat less in bed recently, as Hugo really hates it, but it doesn’t seem to make a difference to how much I get accused. When Hugo and I get into bed at night, I’ve noticed he’s paranoid about crumbs, even when there aren’t any. He will say, “Agh, the sheets feel like sandpaper on my legs.” He can be dramatic, but the thing is, most of the time there is no food left in the bed because I’m a clean freak. I remove the crumbs and vacuum, and also change the sheets once a week. So, Hugo is imagining crumbs. I guess it’s a bit like “the boy who cried wolf”. Nowadays, he just doesn’t believe me. It’s probably my fault.",guilty,high
"My housemate and best friend spends every waking minute on TikTok I’ve known Marley for about seven years and she’s always been quite reliant on her phone as she works in social media, but she’s now seriously addicted to it, even after she’s clocked off. If she puts it down for 10 minutes she gets agitated. I hid her phone once to see how long it would take before she flipped and she couldn’t hack it for more than two minutes. She was like “Where is it?!” It was like watching a smoker cluck for their next fag. I hid her phone once to see how long it would take before she flipped and she couldn’t hack it for more than two minutes We moved in together in 2020 just before the pandemic, and that’s when I really noticed how bad her phone addiction was. Marley never has the phone out of her hand and she constantly scrolls when we are watching TV or having a conversation. I find it a bit rude. It’s also annoying when you’re trying to concentrate on a TV programme and she’s got her phone on full volume, watching reels. When she’s working from home at the same time as me, I can hear her videos from the next room. I get disturbed by these weird songs on repeat, and she constantly quotes trending videos. When there was a viral video about a boy eating corn a while back, she’d just randomly burst into song, singing “It’s corn! A big lump with knobs” around the flat about 50 times a day. Marley will look up literally everything on TikTok. We got a new coffee maker recently and she spent four hours researching people’s video reviews before deciding on which brand to get. I was fine with just reading some Amazon reviews. I asked to see her screen time the other day. I couldn’t actually believe it when it said 12 hours – a day . I told her she’s going to get square eyes, but she just laughed. Actually, her eyesight isn’t great, and I wonder if this is making it worse. Marley needs to ease off on the phone usage for her own good, but she could also stop blasting videos around the house when I’m trying to watch TV or have a chat. I can deal with a bit of singing but I’m not on TikTok myself so I can’t really relate.","My job means I have to be on the ball with what’s trending online My phone is permanently glued to my hand, I agree with James there. But I don’t think it’s got much to do with him. If I want to make myself blind by spending nine hours a day on TikTok, so what? He should just let me. I don’t go around blasting videos at full volume all the time; I think that’s only happened a handful of times. When James asks me to turn something down when he’s watching the telly, I oblige. And I’m not socially inept – I don’t watch things when someone is talking to me. He’s exaggerating there. This month my usage is down to seven hours a day which I think is actually quite good But yes, I was shocked when James checked and saw that I was using my phone for 12 hours a day. That’s not normal though. I checked and this month my usage is down to about seven hours a day, which I think is quite good seeing as I work in ads and socials for a big company. My job means I have to be on the ball with what’s trending online. I literally get paid to research these things. Sometimes I get sucked into the musicality of a viral video. CornTok was great. This kid went viral talking about how delicious sweetcorn is and someone remixed it into a catchy track, which took over TikTok. It was stuck in my head for weeks and I was singing it loads. I showed James the video, but I don’t think he found it funny. James and I work different hours so he’s really not aware of the full extent of my phone habits. He’s rarely in the house when I’m working, and this insinuation that he can hear me blasting videos from my room is far-fetched. I think he’s jealous because I get to do this as part of my career, and he’s got a rather boring job in accounting. Related: You be the judge: should my flatmate stop washing her dog in the bath? I generally think TikTok is great and I’d be so upset if it got banned. It’s great for finding out about new places when travelling, for product reviews from real people, and for entertainment. I’ve lost countless hours to the app, but I don’t mind. I probably won’t ever detox – and I don’t think I need to. I’m also happy to make James a TikTok account too – if he’s up for it.",guilty,high
"Amaan complains it costs too much, but I think being comfortable is important My husband Amaan is always really stingy about me putting the air-con on in our RV when we are travelling. We recently completed a big trip around Europe in it with our nine-month-old baby Sidney, and I had to really make the case to turn it on. The RV is quite big, and I’ll often head towards the back, where I have more space to feed and look after Sidney while Amaan drives. It’s really hot back there. I will be sticky and sweating as we drive through the country, and will ask to put the air-con on. Amaan will complain and say it’s too expensive. But I don’t care. When I’m looking after Sidney I want to be comfortable. After a while Amaan will give in, but he won’t want to. Sometimes I’ll be sitting in the front next to him at first, then when I retreat to the back with Sidney I’ll think: “Hmm, it’s suddenly got warm.” I’ll then go back to the front and see that Amaan’s already turned the air-con off. He says we need to save money because there’s a cost of living crisis . Apparently running the air-con burns the petrol more quickly, but I don’t know how much of a difference this makes. When Amaan is being tight, I’ll point out that we’re travelling in my parents’ RV. That helps us save a lot on accommodation. My parents also pay the vehicle tax and insurance, so our trips in it are cheap. When Amaan is being tight, I’ll point out we are travelling in my parent’s RV. That helps us save a lot on accommodation We don’t need to save any more on top of that, and I reckon the cost of keeping the air-con on during our journeys is negligible. Our longest stint in the car was about five to six hours when it was 24C outside, so I didn’t want to compromise on comfort, but Amaan was adamant. Amaan also thinks that whoever is driving should be in charge, but I don’t agree with that. It’s not like I’m a passenger-princess. I am the chief baby caretaker for one. I’m also the map reader, DJ, lunch researcher and morale booster, so my voice is also valid. Amaan needs to stop being so tight because I’m not prepared to scrimp on air-con costs when we take my parent’s RV out on the road again.","There is a cost of living crisis, so Bree has to be realistic. We need to save money where we can I’m not totally opposed to air-con in the RV, but I think we need to be sensible about it. I’ll suggest starting it on a low setting, but Bree will want to make it a full-on fridge. Bree doesn’t seem to be able to regulate her body temperature like a normal person. She is either boiling hot or freezing – it’s strange. I read an article once that said you shouldn’t set air-con more than five degrees lower than the natural temperature outside, but sometimes she wants it to be too cool. I also think that blowing air from the fan is more economical than putting on the air-con for hours, so I will suggest that instead as it has the same effect. She is sometimes OK with that as a compromise, but other times she’ll get agitated that she can’t have her way. But there is a cost of living crisis, so she has to be realistic. We need to save where we can as we’ve just had a baby. We’re relying on one salary now because Bree is on unpaid maternity leave. I looked into the maths to see how fuel efficiency is affected by having the air-con on, and it’s quite a lot. Studies show that air-con can increase fuel consumption by as much as 20%. I think that’s a waste of money. Fuel is so expensive these days. I’m also concerned for the state of the planet – our baby Sidney will be inheriting it after all Also, I take the view that whoever is driving should control conditions in the RV. Admittedly that suits me because I do most of the driving, but I can see Bree’s point that she also does lots. She’ll be busy researching lunch spots and accommodation options as well as looking after Sidney, so I appreciate that. I’m also a bit of an ecowarrior, I guess. I like to take the train when I can, and I’m also concerned for the state of the planet – Sidney will be inheriting it after all. I would quite like Bree’s parents to give us the RV for more trips. That would be amazing – I do love it. We saved a lot with our last trip because they lent us the RV free of charge, and we camped inside it a lot of the time. But on our next trip, I’ll stand by my opinion that we shouldn’t really have the air-con on.",guilty,high
"Barry vapes anywhere and everywhere. It’s rude, embarrassing and makes me cough I think vaping is antisocial but my partner, Barry, does it all the time in public. I think it’s quite an imposition, because it affects everyone around us, but he doesn’t seem to care. He will vape anywhere: in restaurants and bars, and on country walks. I’m 52 and I used to smoke but don’t any more. Barry is 55. We’ve been together for five years. I hate the acrid smell of vape pens. I have seen him accidentally blow smoke in children’s faces at football matches. But Barry would rather wait to be asked not to vape than seek permission. He’s been asked to stop by the stadium stewards, and once by our friends on a bus. It’s embarrassing. Another time, in a pub, he was trying to vape without being seen. The waiter came over and said something like: “If I don’t see you, it’s fine.” Barry and I interpreted that very differently. I took it to mean: when I see you, the vaping has to stop. But Barry saw it as a green light to just go for it. You fall in love and initially accept everything about the other person, but gradually the vaping began to irritate me I also think he’s addicted. He doesn’t even seem to realise that he’s constantly vaping. When we first got together, it didn’t bother me. You fall in love and initially accept everything about the other person, but gradually it began to irritate me. We don’t know the long-term effects. Barry says it’s good for his health, as he used to smoke cigarettes, but what about the health of everyone around him? I also noticed that I had a constant cough this winter, which went away when I didn’t see Barry for a while. The next time we saw each other, he was vaping beside me and the cough came back. He has agreed to no longer vape next to me, which I’m grateful for. We are set to move in together this month as the last of our children – we both have grown-up kids from previous relationships – recently left for university. But Barry works from home all day, whereas I go into an office. It could really bother me if I come back and smell the vapours in the house, even if he only vapes when I’m away. How’s that going to work? It could be tricky.","Vaping has saved my life. I try to do it politely but I’m not giving it up I started smoking in sixth form, back in 1984, when I was turning 17. And I finally gave up when I was 40 and getting into marathon running. I had one slip-up and reverted to smoking temporarily, but then vaping arrived. It saved my life, really. I used to smoke 15 roll-ups a day, but vaping has fewer health risks. Vaping is actually not banned in pubs in the UK – it’s down to each landlord to decide. That time Carol and I were debating this, I called the waiter over to ask if I was allowed to vape. He said something like: “Well, if I don’t notice, don’t worry about it.” I took that as the fella turning a blind eye, but Carol thought I was still breaking the rules by vaping there. Luckily, there’s a 24-hour e-liquid shop near me. I love the pineapple and berry flavours best To be polite, I’ll blow the vapour down towards the ground when I’m in a pub and blow it upwards, away from neighbours, at football matches. The thing with that, though, is it’s a dead giveaway. The bloody stewards always come over and tell me off. I’m not rude about it, and admit that the wind could blow the smoke into someone’s face. Carol thinks there are three of us in this relationship: me, her and the vape. But I don’t agree with her that the vape is bad. I can run 5km in 20 minutes, or go on the exercise bike for 30 minutes. That’s great for a 55-year-old. I also love how I can vape in bed and at work. You have to go outside to smoke cigarettes in public, and indoors they are a fire risk – but you can vape anywhere. It’s also cheap. I spend about £10 a week on e-liquids and, luckily, there’s a 24-hour shop near me. I love the pineapple and berry flavours best. I don’t think I’m addicted, and I’d compare my habit to Carol being on her phone all the time, although she won’t agree with that. When Carol and I move in together it will be fine. I won’t vape in her presence but I will vape while I work, when she’s not around. I love vaping with a cup of coffee and some jazz. And because the smell doesn’t linger, if she comes in, I’m sure she won’t notice. I’ll get away with it.",guilty,high
"Sade is obsessed with lip balm and applies it hundreds of times a day. I think it’s bad for her My girlfriend Sade has an unhealthy obsession with lip balms. If she doesn’t have one at hand, she freaks out. She literally can’t sleep until her lips are coated in something. She says her lips get super dry if she doesn’t use balms and butters. But I think that’s because her body has got accustomed to them. I once showed her an article about “lazy lips”, which suggested that if you apply lip balm too often it does more harm than good, because your lips become reliant on the product and lose the ability to moisturise themselves. Sade said it was rubbish – but if she goes without lip balm for a day, she complains about dry lips. That’s not normal. Most people should be able to go a day without lip balm. I certainly can. Sade has about five pots of Carmex on the go right now. One is mouldy Ten years ago, when we first got together, she carried a little tin of Vaseline in her pocket. She had every flavour: the green one, the pink one, the cocoa butter one. But one day she read about how petroleum jelly comes from crude oil, so switched to Carmex. I recommended a beeswax lip balm and have even bought her some natural ones over the years. She uses them for a bit but then reverts to Carmex, which is slightly annoying as the ones I buy are more expensive and, I think, better. But while her products may change, the obsession remains. She sleeps with lip balm under her pillow. She has about five pots of Carmex right now, all well past their best. One is black and mouldy around the lid; another is covered in sand from a recent holiday. They are all half-finished because she panic buys a new one when she can’t find the others. I remind her that they aren’t cheap any more. Recently she paid £5 for a pot of Carmex at a petrol station, which I found a bit outrageous. Bedtimes are held up if she can’t locate her lip balm, and she puts it on first thing in the morning and then about a million times throughout the day. Her habit is expensive and it’s probably not very good for her, so I’d like to try to wean her off it.","I’ve loved the feeling of balm on my lips since I was a child. It’s pricey, but doesn’t do any harm I admit that I am reliant on my lip balms – I can’t really say why. The obsession started when I was a child. I developed chapped lips one day while walking to school in the cold with my mum. She put some Vaseline on my lips and I liked how it felt, so I kept using it after my lips healed. I used to love all the limited-edition Vaselines – I had one in every colour and flavour. The cocoa butter one was the best. But I switched to Carmex after I read that it’s better for you. The ingredients in lip balms don’t cause addictions. I’ve done my research Dami moans that I leave half-used tubs of Carmex around our home, but it’s hard to finish one. I actually can’t remember ever getting to the bottom of one – I always lose them first. Dami hates that I buy another pot before I’ve located the half-used ones. He also reminds me that lip balms aren’t cheap any more, which he’s right about. We’re in a cost of living crisis but I recently paid £5 for a pot of Carmex. It didn’t help that I found two lost pots when we got home. I remember when they used to be 99p, so I get his frustration – the cost of my collection adds up. But when I need my lips moisturised, I don’t really care – I’ll use whatever I can get my hands on. At night I can’t sleep until I’ve applied some balm. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes The ingredients in lip balms can’t cause addictions – I’ve done my research – but I’m probably addicted psychologically. I think it’s just a harmless habit. I also have loads of lip glosses and soft lipsticks. I just love having something on my lips. I once read about how much petroleum jelly women ingest from licking balm off their lips. That was a bit worrying – Dami joked that I probably have a big ball of jelly in my stomach as I’ve been applying it for most of my life. I don’t plan on giving up my balms, and I don’t think my obsession is that serious. Dami has bought me some more natural lip balms over the years and I use those too, but the Carmex is my favourite. I always joke that he’ll have to prise it from my cold dead hands before I give it up.",innocent,medium
"Andrea will suddenly decide it’s lights out, and gives me no time to finish my chapter or episode I don’t think it’s reasonable if, when you’re sharing a bed with a partner and they suddenly decide they need to sleep, you have to follow. But that’s how it works with my wife, Andrea. I’ll be reading or watching something and suddenly it’s lights out. There’s no wind-down or “finish your chapter or episode”; it’s just the guillotine – goodnight. She often wants to go to sleep at 9.30pm, which is too early for me as I’m a night owl. It doesn’t matter that I’m there watching a bit of telly; all that matters is Andrea is ready for bed so I have to be too. She can’t sleep with me watching TV next to her, even if I have headphones in. And I’m not allowed to use the bedside light after she goes to sleep. I often say: “What is the point of a bedside light, if its sole function is not allowed?” And she will reply: “If you want to do anything past my bedtime, you’ve got to go downstairs.” When Andrea wants to turn the light off, she transforms into a different person – a bedroom monster I think it’s quite harsh, particularly if I’m in the middle of something and it’s winter, when in bed is the warmest place to be. We don’t have a TV right now, so I watch a lot of things on my computer in bed. Andrea says I spend too much time in bed, but I like being wrapped up and comfy. When it’s cold, I’d rather just be lying down. I also work from bed in the daytime when I should really be at the kitchen table – it’s just the best position in the house. Though my spine doesn’t agree. Andrea gets very anxious if it gets too late in the evening and she’s not asleep. It started after we had kids. They are six and four, and get us up around five in the morning, so actually I’m quite grateful to go to sleep early. Though at night, when Andrea wants to turn the light off, she transforms into a different person – a bedroom monster, I would say. One of three things usually happens. Either I’ll concede and go to bed cross, which isn’t healthy. Or I’ll say, “This is outrageous”, and we hash it out, but I’ll still go to bed feeling quite cross. Or I’ll move and go downstairs. Perhaps I should accept it, but I just don’t like losing the battle.","Any light stops me from sleeping. If he wants to read or watch something, he can go downstairs I’m upset that I’m being prosecuted – in fact, I feel that I should be the one doing the prosecuting. The main purpose of the bedroom is to sleep and to rest. As soon as one person wants to go to sleep, it should be lights out and sleep time, because that’s what the bedroom is for. That should take priority – you can’t have a blazing light on while someone else is trying to get some shut-eye. Some people might be more relaxed about it, but any light stops me from sleeping and I can’t deal with all the rustling of someone watching something on a laptop next to me. I don’t use eye masks as they make me feel claustrophobic. So if Wilmer wants to carry on reading or watching something, he can go downstairs. If we do watch something together, I can’t do more than two episodes in a row anyway. He can continue for two or three hours, but I get bored. He says I sleep too much, but this is a man who used to lock himself in the loo at work for a nap The root of our issue is that he spends too much time in bed and has no division between his work and play. I’ll come home and our bed will be covered with his sheets and folders. I have to take them off and convert it back to a non-work space. He says I sleep too much, but this is coming from a man who used to lock himself in the loo at work for a nap. I’d say I’m also busier than him – always doing things or out and about. Wilmer’s not lazy, but he loves the bed more than me. Related: You be the judge: should my fiance agree to open a joint bank account with me? I admit I became completely neurotic about sleep after having kids. I was sleep-deprived for so long. You need lights out by 9.30pm if you’re going to wake up at 4am. Wilmer is also better at handling being sleep-deprived; I fall into a puddle of tears and become a horrible person. We should both stop watching TV in bed. I don’t mind reading before sleep as it helps you wind down. When Wilmer reads, he only manages a page before he’s out. Strictness helps us stick to a sleep routine. When I think back to the times when I’ve made us go to sleep, rarely has Wilmer’s desire to continue watching or reading something outweighed his desire to stay in bed.",innocent,high
"I can’t stand it when he does it in public, or finding pieces of his nails all over the house There are quite a few gross things that men do, but at my age you just learn to put up with them. My husband, Trevor, and I have been married for over 40 years, but one thing he’s never stopped is his nail-cutting habit, which I still find repulsive. Since I’ve known him, Trevor has always carried an all-in-one pocket knife and nail-clipper around in his trouser pocket, along with tissues or a hanky. He will whip out the clippers at any given opportunity to snip away at his nails. He sometimes even picks the dirt out from under them and wipes it on his handkerchief. I always chastise him for it because who wants to watch a man do that? He’s learned not to do it in polite company, but I still have to put up with it. I even recall him doing it as we sat outside a cafe many years ago. Our daughter was very little and we were just married. I gave him a right telling off. His clippings were flying all over the place. But every so often Trevor will surprise me and still do it openly. This Christmas just past, suddenly I heard ‘snip…snip…snip.’ And there he was, chopping away at his nails This Christmas Day we had our daughter over with her children as usual. After dinner we were sitting down watching the telly. Our grandkids were playing with their new toys and I was dozing off. Then suddenly I hear this “snip … snip … snip”. I know we were among family, but it was really quite repulsive. I said: “Don’t do that! It’s Christmas Day.” Trevor said he would tidy up the clippings, except he never does. I can’t stand it when I clean the house and find all these bits of nail everywhere. Trevor worked as a gardener for years before he retired, and was always getting soil and dirt under his nails. That has fostered in him, I think, a desire to look and stay clean all the time. He still can’t have a speck of dirt under his nails. And he is always clipping them, even if they are really quite short. I say, “There’s nothing left to chop”. He could afford to leave them alone for a bit longer. And he should make sure to clip them in the bathroom and not in front of me. I’ve really had enough.","If I see a speck of dirt under my nails I just have to clean it out. That’s how I’ve been brought up A man needs to make sure his hands are clean and his nails are short. I think it’s quite unsightly when someone has dirt underneath their nails. I always think: well, they must have very poor personal hygiene. I have always carried around a little pocket knife and nail clippers because that’s how I’ve been brought up. When I was a boy, my mother taught me to keep neat and clean. She used to say: “Clean boy, clean mind. Dirty boy, dirty mind.” I worked outside as a landscaper and gardener for practically all of my career, dealing with soil, grass and fertiliser. It has made me obsessed with cleanliness, because sometimes I’d spend the whole day covered in mud. If I see a speck of dirt under my nails, I just have to clean it out. I’m grateful to her for not getting too annoyed with my nail-clipping, but I can’t say I’m sorry for doing it Edwina and I have been married for 43 years. You learn to put up with people’s habits after that long, I suppose. I’m grateful to her for not getting too annoyed with my nail-clipping and dirt-scraping, but I can’t say I’m sorry for doing it. When we were courting, I probably hid it from her a little more, but then I suppose I got lazy. She’s told me off so many times for doing it in public, but I only do that when I’m outside and the nails can sort of disappear. On a park bench or outside in a cafe – those sorts of places. I have got better over the years and generally only do my nails when Edwina is not around, because she starts shrieking at the sight. In the shower is best, of course, but sometimes the moment just comes upon you. The Christmas episode was just because I had spotted some dirt under them at that very moment. Our daughter and her children have never said anything, only Edwina. If a man can’t cut his nails in the privacy of his own home, where can he do them? Edwina says I don’t collect the cuttings, but I most definitely do. Sometimes it’s quite hard to find them though. That’s my excuse, anyway. I try to make sure I only clip and clean my nails when Edwina isn’t around, but it’s like a compulsion.",guilty,high
"Mum has strong ideas on how I should present myself and calls my body hair ‘unladylike’ My mum is always nagging me about my beauty regime, which, as an adult, I find annoying. She is always telling me what to do with my body hair. I think her sentiments are a product of her cultural upbringing. We are Muslim and Middle Eastern, and Mum has always had strong opinions about how to present as a feminine woman. Waxing my leg hair, bikini area, arms and upper lip was encouraged from the moment I started to develop at 14, and I know her mother suggested the same when she was growing up. But as I’ve got older, I’ve rejected some of these norms. I don’t really shave or wax my legs and arms any more as I can’t be bothered. I’ve had boyfriends and they don’t care. In the UK, we spend so much time covered up, I don’t think it’s necessary to be worried about hair all the time. My mum jokes that I’ll never find a husband if I let all my hair grow I’ve taken to growing my underarm hair in the winter, so it’s quite long now. I reckon it’s because I went away to university in Germany two years ago and found more women who thought like me. I also learned a lot of feminist theory that supported my ideas. But after I graduated and moved back home, my mum called my body hair “unladylike”. I ended up giving in and waxing again a few times. The one thing I could never stop waxing, however, was my upper lip. Growing up, my mum always threaded hers, but a few years ago she got this battery-powered hair remover and I started nicking it because it was so good and painless. She bought me my own and I use it every couple of weeks. My mum jokes that I’ll never find a husband if I let all my hair grow. But I’m only 22 and don’t want to get married anyway. I try to explain the concept of the male gaze, and how much women pander to it, but she doesn’t get it. My sister, who is 27 and single like me, also gets comments about her appearance, but I get it worse. My parents do it in a lighthearted way, but my mum really does worry that I’m ruining my chances of getting married. We try to educate our parents on how their views can be harmful, but it never does any good.","When it comes to beauty, I know best – and thick body hair sends out the wrong message I always say Imani thinks she’s too fancy to be feminine. She’s a very smart girl, but since she came back from university she thinks she knows it all. I never try to control her or her sister. I only give advice because I want to help. When it comes to beauty, of course I know best. I am their mother and I’ve been in their position. I know what it’s like to be a single young woman, trying to find a way in the world. But I’m married now and one reason why is because I’ve always taken pride in my appearance. In a Middle Eastern and Muslim culture like ours, how a woman presents herself sends out a very strong message. Waxing has always been a part of my beauty regime. I introduced it to the girls when they hit puberty I’d be lying if I said marriage wasn’t important to me. I want my daughters to be taken care of, I want them to have a family. I just worry that they are too independent. I came to this country from Lebanon with their father 28 years ago. We had to adjust to the British way of doing things, but with hair removal and beauty treatments, I have always done what is normal to me – that means staying well groomed. Waxing has always been a part of my beauty regime. I introduced it to the girls when they hit puberty because we all have very dark hair and it’s normal for us to remove it. My mother always said it was important, and I’ve passed that on to my girls. Imani loves the hair-removal tool I’ve used for the last couple of years, so I bought her one and I’m happy to say she still uses it on her face. I started laser hair removal on my legs and bikini area a few years ago and it’s great – much better than waxing as it’s permanent and not as painful. I implore Imani to do the same, but she won’t listen. She’s rejected a lot of beauty advice that I taught her and, honestly, I am offended. I also don’t think it looks nice. She can have her opinions, but not everyone needs to hear them. Going around with such thick hair on her arms, legs and armpits sends the wrong message to the world. As long as she’s in my home I’ll continue to petition her to take care of herself. That’s what mothers do.",guilty,high
"Agnieszka tells our friends that meat is murder, but then will eat bacon at home Agnieszka calls herself a vegan and tells everyone she doesn’t eat meat and animal products as she believes it to be cruel, but when we are at home she is more lax. That’s fine – she doesn’t have to deny herself her favourite foods just to prove some moral or political point. But the performance she puts on in front of other people irritates me sometimes. We will go to a restaurant with friends and she will make a big deal about refusing to try certain foods. If someone asks why, she will give them the spiel about how meat is murder. That’s fine if they are interested, but it can be a bit much. The most annoying thing is when she gets home and then raids the chocolate or cheesy crackers. The performance she puts on in front of other people irritates me sometimes She has been a “vegan” for about a year, so it is still new to her, but it’s funny how often she slips up. A few months into it I was cooking a fry-up and she leaned over and said: “Oh can I have a piece of that bacon?” I said to her: “Aren’t you a vegan? What’s going on?” She told me not to police her choices and ate some. I laughed – I wasn’t policing her, just holding her accountable. She doesn’t really like it when I joke about her being a bit lax in front friends and family. One time at the pub I exposed her bacon-eating in front of my brother. It was in jest but Agnieszka was annoyed and said I was trying to embarrass her. That was the one time we really argued, but it wasn’t about her veganism at all; it was about her being hypocritical. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes Agnieszka hasn’t tried to ram her opinions down my throat and doesn’t tell me I can’t keep meat in the fridge. I like a lot of the dishes she suggests and am grateful for how she has educated me on issues around food. It’s just that when she slips up, I feel she should own it. I find the performative aspect of being a vegan a bit strange.","I’m adjusting to a new diet and have slipped up a few times. Dylan is being annoying When you transition into a new diet, it obviously takes some getting used to. I don’t think it’s healthy to cut out all animal products overnight. It needs to be a gradual thing. Dylan’s great but he could be a little more supportive. He loves telling people I’m a fake vegan and has made jokes in front of our friends about me being hypocritical. He called me out in front of his brother over eating bacon when I was just a few weeks into my veganism. At the time I just craved the taste of it, but Dylan has reminded me of it so many times since, I don’t think it was worth it. I didn’t take it well when he called me a “fegan” in front of his brother. When we got home, I said to him, “Don’t ever do that again,” because it felt like he was trying to put me down. I hate this weird word: what even is a “fegan”? He did apologise but I was annoyed for days. Dylan needs to stop making jokes about my lifestyle in public – in private he is actually quite supportive I don’t try to change his habits at home, and I am not controlling about his diet, so why is he trying so hard to get involved with mine? We have lived together for two years and share the cooking. If Dylan wants to eat meat in front of me I have no problem with that. But I have slowly tried to introduce more vegan dishes into his life, which I think he appreciates. I went vegan because I believe that eating fewer animal products will be better for me and the environment. The production of meat and dairy can be so inhumane, and the fact that so many of us aren’t aware of the cruelty is worrying. I tell people what I know about the brutality of the meat industry only when they ask. When we go out for meals I don’t think I am preachy or tell our friends what to eat. Everyone can make their own decisions – I am only concerned with my diet. Dylan needs to stop making jokes about my lifestyle in front of other people because in private he is actually quite supportive and interested in veganism – so it’s him that’s being a bit performative.",guilty,medium
"Jon bins perfectly good clothes as soon as they have a tiny hole or stain, which is so wasteful We live in a society that doesn’t like repairing things. People just throw out clothes and appliances rather than trying to fix them, and my husband Jon is one of them. He’s always been like this and I have pretty much accepted it, but it does annoy me. Sometimes I forget how wasteful he is until he does something reprehensible in front of me. The other day, he was getting dressed for work and pulled out a white shirt which had a tiny ketchup stain on it. He immediately said: “Oh, that’s going in the rubbish,” and put it straight in the bin. I was like: “What are you doing? You can just wash it.” He said it was pointless; the shirt was ruined. I think that’s incredibly wasteful; you can easily take out stains with stain remover – the mark wasn’t even that big. Or the shirt could have gone to a charity shop, but when Jon gets something into his head, that’s it. Once I found a pair of gym shoes in the recycling bin Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes He throws out perfectly good shorts, trousers and shirts with tiny holes or minuscule stains. He wouldn’t be organised enough to sort through his items and donate them. Once I found a pair of gym shoes in the recycling bin. When I challenged him he said that there was a rip on the back. I took the shoes to a local cobbler and returned them to him. He was very grateful but said: “Why did you do this? It’s easier to buy new ones.” Recently he dropped his Macbook and a couple of the buttons on the keyboard fell off. Instead of taking it to be repaired, he just ordered a brand new laptop. I lectured him on this too. We make decent money as a couple and I suppose we can afford to buy new items every time something gets tatty, but I would prefer not to. I think I am opposed to waste because I was raised in a working-class home, and my mum would always sew patches on my school jumper instead of buying a whole new one. So my brain is wired differently from Jon’s, who grew up with more money. I’ll sometimes just get his stuff repaired for him, but I think Jon should learn to see the value in that himself.","There’s no point holding onto things you don’t want. I throw them straight in the bin I don’t like wearing clothes that have stains or holes. It makes you look tatty and dirty. And I also think, what’s the point in holding on to things that you don’t want? I like my wardrobe – and my life – to be full of things that I actually value. So when something is no longer providing value, I throw it out. It’s more efficient to live that way. I have an office job so I can’t wear dirty items, which is why I threw out the ketchup-stained shirt. Martina knows my job has a smart-casual dress code, so I’m not sure why she would want me to keep clothes that don’t cut the mustard. Martina is more thrifty than I am and perhaps that’s because she grew up with less money than me I also have no qualms about throwing out things that don’t suit me or are past their best. She says I can be wasteful, but I don’t really have the time to sort through my shirts and trousers every morning, seeing which ones are stained and which ones aren’t. I’d rather keep a collection of entirely clean clothes. With the gym shoes that I threw out, perhaps I was a bit hasty. I did appreciate Martina getting them mended as it was just a little hole at the back. Though if I’m honest, I would probably never do that myself. I wouldn’t even know where to find a repair shop like that. Martina is a little more thrifty than I am and perhaps that’s because she grew up with less money than me. She’s very good at stopping me from chucking things straight in the bin. She’ll say: “Hang on, someone will get a second wear out of that,” and then takes it to the charity shop. Of course I like the idea of donating clothes but I just don’t have the time. When something no longer serves a purpose it usually goes straight in the bin without a second thought. But in regards to my broken laptop, I will defend my decision there. The keyboard didn’t work so I couldn’t use it at all, and it was easier to buy a new Macbook. I’m lucky that I can afford to do that, but Martina thought I was being ridiculous. I guess I could try to be a bit less wasteful and get more things repaired, but I will always prioritise saving myself time.",guilty,high
"My tea towels mean a lot to me, but Brent ruins them by clearing up spilt tea and baked beans Before my boyfriend Brent moved in with me two years ago, I had a nice collection of fresh white tea towels. Many were given to me as gifts. But since Brent moved in, most of them have been ruined. Whenever he spills tea or coffee or baked beans, he will wipe up the mess with a tea towel. To me, a tea towel should only be used for drying up clean dishes. Only using them for that meant that they stayed the same colour for years. Until Brent moved in, that is. Before that, I’d go to Brent’s flat and see the state of his tea towels there. I was aware of his habit and pointed out that he shouldn’t be using them to wipe up food. I think I suggested not doing that with mine when he moved in, but obviously that didn’t happen. Brent does the cooking in our relationship, and I do most of the cleaning up afterwards. He’s very enthusiastic and creative in the kitchen and I really appreciate that, but I just think: leave my tea towels alone. Brent says he has a system in which he has two tea towels on the go when he’s in the kitchen. He says he sets aside one for cleaning and the other for drying, but from what I can see there is no system. He just uses all the tea towels for wiping up spills. The tea towels are quite personal to me. Some of them were souvenirs from friends abroad I like using kitchen roll to wipe surfaces. Brent has pointed out that it’s very wasteful and that I should use J cloths for wiping up. I actually agree and have asked him to do the same, but he never does. Brent also doesn’t like washing things on a high heat, and I think that’s another reason the stains in my tea towels don’t come out. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes The tea towels are quite personal to me. Some of them were souvenirs from friends abroad. My mum also got me a few to match my new colour scheme when I got the kitchen redone. One of my favourites, which had a joke about grammar on it and used to be white, is now grey all over, plus a few food stains. Brent says I’m too sentimental about them. I just believe they should only be used to dry wet items – that’s it.","I do most of the cooking so there’s bound to be mess. And we can just throw them in the wash There is one tea towel that Lucy loves – the one with a grammar joke on it – and I’ve stained it forever, so perhaps that is what she is most annoyed about. But when I moved in, I wasn’t aware that tea towels can be objects to be sentimental about. In my defence, I’m an enthusiastic cook and do almost all the cooking in our flat, so really I think it’s fair enough if the cost is a bit of mess. I keep two tea towels close to me, one for drying stuff up, which stays clean, and the other for wiping surfaces in a hurry. When one gets too dirty, you chuck it in the wash and get out a clean one. That’s the system that’s worked for me and I like it. My dad was an army chef and taught me to “clean as you go”, and I always do. But I often grab a tea towel to wipe up as I’m usually in a rush. Lucy has asked me not to use her tea towels for this, and I’ll say, “yeah, of course, no problem.” But in the heat of the moment I grab what’s nearest. Maybe this habit is a reflection of my life in general. I’m a photographer and my life is very chaotic and last-minute. Lucy is tidy but she always uses kitchen roll to wipe up, which I think is a bit wasteful. Tea towels can be washed and reused so it makes sense to use them to wipe up. Tea towels are a functional item which are there to be used, not hung on the wall for decoration Lucy also says I don’t wash the tea towels on a high enough setting, but I don’t think that’s true. I wash everything at about 40C. It’s the quality of soap that determines whether things come out clean. Some tea towels, unfortunately, are just stained forever now. Tea towels are a functional item which are there to be used, not hung on the wall for decoration. Lucy has suggested keeping some tea towels in a separate area, to use for drying only. I think that idea has potential, but when I’m cooking I would need to put in a lot of effort to keep them in a different part of the kitchen and not forget and reach for the wrong ones. Our kitchen isn’t massive, so logistically I might get them muddled up, but we’ll see.",guilty,medium
"Ama always tries to put the dishwasher on – even for three plates and a few forks and breakfast bowls There aren’t many things in life that grind my gears – just ask my wife, Audrey – but I cannot abide wastefulness and laziness. My daughter Ama is a blessing, but she can be very lazy and it pains me to see it. She’s in her final year of sixth form and lives with Audrey and I. She helps out with chores around the house, but is always cutting corners. When it’s her turn to do the washing up she will say: “OK, but we have the dishwasher.” Audrey and I will only use the dishwasher when we have guests, or lots of dirty dishes. When it’s just the three of us, we tend to do the washing up by hand. I think she just can’t be bothered to roll up her sleeves and get scrubbing Ama, however, always tries to use the dishwasher. I don’t believe three plates, a few forks and some breakfast bowls is a good enough reason to put it on. Think about how much water that is being used. A dishwasher should be full or stay off. Ama says we can let the plates build up every two days, then put it on, which I don’t mind as much. But I still don’t like the idea of dirty cutlery inside it for days until it becomes full. It’s unhygienic and lazy. I’d rather we wash things by hand as much as possible. But Ama is 18 now and thinks she knows best. She says: “Dad, studies show it’s better to put a dishwasher on once a day, blah blah.” I think she just can’t be bothered to roll up her sleeves and get scrubbing. We’ve even caught Ama putting the dishwasher on with only two plates in it. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes In my day, growing up in Nigeria, we washed everything by hand. We didn’t rely on machines because we didn’t have them. When I moved to London, I lived in a shared house without a dishwasher and got accustomed to washing by hand. I’ve only lived in a home with a dishwasher for 10 years. Maybe I’m not used to it and never will be. But one thing I do know is that the energy bills are rising, so I’m more conscious than ever of wasting water and electricity. Ama should heed my advice because when she goes out into the world on her own and has to pay her own bills, she’ll realise how expensive everything is.","Using the dishwasher is more economical than washing up – and helps the environment too Dad loves to make out he’s Mr Economical when it comes to the dishwasher, but a quick Google shows he’s in the wrong. I’ve read that putting the dishwasher on once a day rather than washing everything by hand is much better for saving money and helping the environment. I’ve shown him the articles: they say filling up a sink twice a day uses more power and costs more than running a dishwasher once a day. This is because it takes the dishwasher less time to heat up water than running a tap, and we always use hot, soapy water to wash up. But he won’t listen. He says: “Back in my day we scrubbed everything. You need to roll up your sleeves and do it.” Dad enjoys seeing me struggle doing the washing up because he never had a dishwasher growing up We only use the dishwasher if we have had guests over or have used really big pots and pans. Before school I have to wash my stuff up, then most evenings I scrub the plates again. But if we just stacked the dishwasher after every meal and put it on once a day, it would be better. Washing up is much more time-consuming than putting everything in a dishwasher. I don’t get why we can’t use it if we have it. I think Dad enjoys seeing me struggle doing the washing up because he never had a dishwasher growing up. But I shouldn’t have to suffer just because my parents did. Sometimes I’ll put the dishwasher on when he’s not home and there are only a few plates. I know it will get me in trouble but I don’t care. I’m lucky in that mum and dad don’t ask me to do loads of chores. I’m an only child and they know I have to get on with exams and homework. After mum has cooked dinner, I’ll sometimes clear the table and help with the plates – if they let me put everything in the dishwasher. When they don’t, it makes me reluctant to help, because washing by hand takes so long. I also don’t like the effect it has on my hands and nails as we hardly ever have rubber gloves around. Dad needs to listen to my suggestions about the dishwasher because they make perfect sense. We should switch it on more – it will save us all time and money.",innocent,medium
"Lara says sharing my toothbrush is just the same as us kissing. But it’s not. It’s gross There’s quite a few gross things about being in a relationship, but I’ll stick with the PG-rated ones for now: I hate it when my girlfriend Lara uses my toothbrush. It happens whenever she stays over at mine, or when we go away for weekends. She never seems to pack her own. We’ve been together just under a year and it’s time for Lara to start remembering to bring one. She stays over around three times a week, but instead of buying a toothbrush and leaving it at mine, she brings her own back and forth. But often forgets. When she remembers, she makes a big deal out of it and asks, “Are you happy now?” The truth is, I’m more unhappy every time she forgets. Even if we were married, I’d still find sharing a toothbrush repulsive. You use it to scrub away nasty gunk from your teeth and mouth – then you’re expected to share it with someone else and take in all their nasty bacteria. When Lara says, “But we kiss, isn’t that the same?” My answer is a firm “No, it’s not.” When you kiss someone, you aren’t deliberately dislodging the food particles from between their teeth. You don’t run your tongue vigorously along their teeth. It’s totally different. I want to kiss Lara but I’ll be damned if I want her to brush the bacteria from her teeth with my toothbrush I want to kiss her, but I’ll be damned if I want her to brush the plaque from her teeth with my toothbrush. When Lara uses my toothbrush, I’ll say, “This is gross. Do you have to?” but she says it’ll be worse and less hygienic for me to experience her bad breath. We’ll argue, I’ll let her use it at the time, then the next morning she’ll use it again. Then I’ll throw it away and get a new one. I’ve taken it upon myself to keep a pack of spare brushes for her, but Lara sometimes takes one home by accident instead of leaving it here. We’re locked into this cycle of arguing about not having a toothbrush on hand – but it’s totally her fault. When I stay over at hers, which is only once a week or so, I’ll always bring mine. Why can’t she just do the same? Or just leave one here? I don’t ever want to share mine again.","I don’t know why it’s such a big deal for Dave. I think it’s more of an ego thing than a hygiene thing I don’t get why toothbrush sharing is a the big deal, I really don’t. We’re a couple and we often kiss. We’re already committed to putting our tongues in each other’s mouths, so what does it matter if we share a toothbrush ? Dave says there’s a difference between swapping bodily bacteria (for pleasure) and swapping food bacteria that comes from a toothbrush, which he says is out of laziness and should be avoided. I see that, but it’s not like I’m his sibling. I’m his girlfriend. It should not gross him out as much as it does. When I stay over, I do sometimes bring my own toothbrush but, as it’s electric, it doesn’t fit in my overnight makeup bag. I’ll rock up at Dave’s and sneakily try to use his toothbrush, but he always makes a huge deal out of it. He’ll say something like: “This is disgusting, you’re grim.” But he has a normal, non-electric toothbrush, which isn’t even as good for removing food, so what’s the big deal if we share? It’s not like there are loads of bits of food hanging off it. I saw Dave throw away his brush after I’d used it and I think that’s really over the top Part of the problem is that I go to his house more than he comes to mine. I am a bit scatty so I’ll always forget something. If he stayed at mine more, perhaps the toothbrush would be less of an issue. I saw Dave throw away his toothbrush the next day after I’d used it, which is really over the top. He’s now taken to buying cheap plastic ones for me to use when I stay at his, but on a couple occasions I’ve accidentally taken them home so the next time I go around, I borrow his again. That drives him nuts. I think this is more of an ego thing than a hygiene thing for Dave. He has a load of gross habits – I won’t reveal them all here, but let’s just say his record is not unblemished when it comes to personal hygiene. He’s been known to skip the odd shower. Related: You be the judge: should my boyfriend clear out his hundreds of old CDs and DVDs? I would rather use his toothbrush and have clean teeth than morning breath, especially if I have to go straight to work from his flat. And I don’t think I should apologise for that as I make more of an effort to go to his than he does coming to mine.",guilty,high
"Abigail secretly turns the radiators on in the day, while we’re out. But we’re trying to keep costs down My daughter Abigail recently moved back home, with me and my husband, Rich. Although I love having her around, she’s a bit demanding with the central heating. We’re trying to keep costs down but she’s constantly driving them up. We’ve set the heating to come on at 6pm every day, when Rich and I arrive home from work. But she moans about it and says, “Mum, it’s always freezing. This house is like a prison.” She’s a graphic designer and works remotely from our house, and always wants it boiling hot, even in winter. We’ve had some arguments. A few times she’s had the heating on all day, only to turn it down again a couple of hours before we get home in the hope we won’t notice. But we weren’t born yesterday; we can tell when we walk in and feel the temperature. Abigail can go to a coffee shop to work if she doesn’t like the house rules, but she says I’m ‘evicting’ her Rich has sometimes come home early and found the radiators scalding hot. Abigail’s defence is she’s working from home and needs the heating on, so she doesn’t freeze. I’ve told her to wait until January, when it gets really cold, then she can start whacking the heating on in the late afternoon. I also think Abigail could go into her office or to a coffee shop to work if she doesn’t like the house rules, but she says I’m “evicting” her. I now have a smart meter so I can see how much we’re spending on gas all day. If Abigail is at home with the heating on and using the oven to heat up her tiny lunches, I can track that. It sounds a bit anal, but I had to get it installed as she was being sneaky, and the rising cost of living means our gas and electricity bills have increased dramatically, like everyone else’s. In Abigail’s previous place the rent included bills, so she isn’t used to worrying about the heating. She just turned everything up to the max when it was cold. That won’t wash in my house and I’ve told her to be more conscious. We’re charging her minimal rent – £300 a month – so she can save up to move out again next year, but in winter I’m considering increasing it to £375 just to cover additional gas costs. I don’t think that’s unreasonable.","I work from home so need the heating on. I feel like a tenant being evicted during the cold Mum and dad love to moan about my use of the heating, but I think it’s a bit of an overreaction. We have radiators installed for a reason, but they freak out when it’s time to use them. Central heating is supposed to be turned on when we need it, but they have this militant schedule where everything is timed. If I deviate from it by turning the radiators on at the weekend, or when it’s just me in the house, they go mad. I work from home more than them, so surely it makes sense that I need to stay warm more. My mum’s forbidden me from switching on the heating until the temperature drops to zero degrees in the mornings, but I’m cold now . Sometimes I have it on when I’m in the house alone, but I switch it off before my parents come back. But somehow they still notice. My dad puts his hand behind the radiator and says, “A-ha! I knew it,” and my mum starts shouting at me, saying I’m selfish. They have suggested I go and work in a coffee shop, but I don’t see why I should be pushed out of my own home. I feel like a tenant being evicted during the cold. I know I’m lucky to pay just £300 a month in rent, but it would be nice if that wasn’t being used against me I was in a houseshare before I moved back home, but it ended as the landlord was selling up and I couldn’t find anywhere else affordable in my area. I know heating and bills have increased, but I guess I didn’t have to think about it much before, as the rent was all-inclusive. I’m saving up to move out again, but with the price of rent in London, it will take me twice as long if they make me spend my salary on overpriced sandwiches in a coffee shop when I could just be working from home. I know I’m lucky that my rent is only £300 a month, but it would be nice if that wasn’t being used against me every time I switch on the heating. I get on with my parents quite well, and I’m not in a hurry to move out again. I think it’s a bit silly to panic so much about pennies on the smart meter and ration the heating. We aren’t well off, but we all work and I pay my way. This obsession with tracking every unit of gas and electricity is just making home a bit less enjoyable for me.",guilty,high
"The discs clutter up the house – and I can’t recall the last time he made use of his collection I’ve been with my boyfriend Jerryl for almost two years, and 15 months ago he moved into my place. I’ve discovered that he loves to keep outdated clutter. We’ve got hundreds of DVDs and CDs around the house. He doesn’t like to chuck stuff out, but I think he should get with the times and use streaming services. He prefers physical copies of things and says it feels special to have a DVD with a bonus feature you can’t find online. Jerryl has this romantic idea that he’s always browsing through his DVDs, then chooses what to watch, but that’s nonsense. In reality, I can’t recall the last time he made use of his vast collection. His DVDs also take up a lot of space: a whole row on the TV stand, which leave my plants squashed, and his CDs take up bookcase space, so I’ve had to move my books. My house is also full of Jerryl’s rubbish, like old suitcases and magazines I’m saving to buy a house, which will be smaller than the one we live in now. There’s no way I’m moving 200 DVDs and loads of CDs in there. My loft is also full of Jerryl’s rubbish, like old suitcases and a stack of NME magazines from the 1990s. He also keeps clothes from the noughties in our spare bedroom – outdated things like cable-knit jumpers and striped brown scarves. About a year ago Jerryl found a chandelier in the street and wanted to put it up in our house, but it’s been sitting in the spare room ever since. The house is quite big, and I’m used to having lots of space. Perhaps I still think of it as my place. Jerryl put an old poster of John F Kennedy up in the spare room the other day without asking me and I didn’t like that. We are good at agreeing on practical things, like decorating and kitchenware, but I do think Jerryl is like an old lady with all his bric-a-brac. He has all this superfluous stuff and just looking at it makes me feel stressed. When we eventually have a clear-out, it will be me who has to drive it to the tip, as Jerryl can’t drive. He should start sorting stuff out now, so in the future it’s easier for us.","My CDs date back to when I was a teenager and carry a lot of sentimental value I lived abroad before moving in with Jarcinda and had my stuff in storage. Since I moved in to her place, she’s said she’s had to compromise more. This is the first time I’ve kept all my belongings in one place, and now she wants me to throw some of it away. Some of the CDs date back to when I was a teenager, and they carry a lot of sentimental value. I don’t see why I should have to give them up as I’m not hurting anyone by holding on to them. Admittedly, I’m not adhering to some minimalist existence, but I don’t want to. I’m less emotionally attached to my DVDs, but I get lost in streaming services and find the choice of films debilitating. There’s also a finite number of films on Amazon and Netflix; you can’t always find rare ones. When she’s out, I’ll watch an old film alone. It’s nice knowing my collection is there when I need it Sometimes I want to watch the original version of Solaris or Drive, with bonus features and the director’s interview. The last DVD I bought was a month ago – the third film in Richard Linklater’s Before trilogy. Jarcinda says, “You don’t listen to your CDs or watch the DVDs regularly enough to warrant keeping them around.” But how regular is regular? I’d love to lounge around all day, but life’s not like that. When she’s out, I’ll watch an old film alone, and it’s nice to know my collection’s there when I need it. I’m a nostalgic person, part of the CD and DVD generation. So is Jarcinda, but she thinks I should modernise. She says she’s had to move her books two levels up on the bookshelf, but it’s just one. And I only have one little shelf of DVDs beneath the TV. The NME magazines and excess clothes I could get rid of, but I won’t put my CDs in plastic wallets. I’ve done that before and they get scratched and ruined. I can throw more stuff away when we buy our house. But it makes me happy at the moment, so why worry? Jarcinda and I are both tidy; we just disagree on what deserves space. I see the therapeutic benefit of her having loads of her plants around, so she should let me keep my stuff. That’s good for my mental health after all.",innocent,medium
"Samantha will wear a big fleece to go for ice-cream in the summer. She makes us all look ridiculous My best friend, Samantha, seems unable to dress for the weather. Even in the hot summer we had this year, she always walked around in a heavy coat. She has a vast collection – big designer puffer jackets, long vintage leather coats and sheepskin fleeces. I think they’re quite cool, but she wears them when they’re not necessary. This year she put on a giant puffer when she was coming to meet me in the height of summer. Another time, she had on this huge fleece while we were getting ice-cream from a van. This year she put on a giant puffer when she was coming to meet me in the height of summer Samantha’s jackets are just incongruous to her surroundings. She doesn’t have a “transitional” wardrobe. It’s winter jackets most of the year, then, when it’s really hot, she will forgo a jacket or wear one of these tiny cropped jumpers. There’s no in-between. We’ve been friends for five years and I have noticed this quirk a bit more this past year. I tell Samantha that she needs to buy a denim jacket or some kind of spring wardrobe, but she’s adamant that her winter jackets are suitable for most of the year. Friends always comments on how weird this is. When we were out as a group this year, we looked a bit ridiculous as Samantha was dressed for Baltic conditions when there wasn’t a cloud in the sky. In my opinion, unless you’re in the depths of winter, you don’t need a huge padded jacket or heavy fleece. When Samantha and I met up this autumn, she was wearing thermals, which I thought a bit mad. We were having brunch and it was 17C. Samantha arrived in her giant padded puffer jacket. I said: “When does ski season start?” Samantha’s response was: “Well it will get cold later.” Samantha should make a few changes to her wardrobe so that when we go out, she doesn’t look like something’s wrong with her. When you see someone wearing a coat that’s too heavy for the weather, you think they must be sick, or a tourist. People should dress for the season. It just makes sense.","I’d rather be too hot than too cold, so I always go out in big coats. Halina should leave me be People love to come for me for wearing jackets that are too heavy, but I don’t think it’s that big a deal. Who wants to be caught short in the British weather? I have a selection of big fleeces and puffer jackets that I wear pretty much all year round and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. My favourite is my Moncler padded jacket, which was really expensive, and another beige fleece that was a charity shop find and is really warm. I must have seven or eight big winter coats that I alternate all year round. Halina will ask me whether I’m looking for a polar bear, or working a ski season It doesn’t make sense to buy what Halina calls “a transitional wardrobe”, because for the most part wearing a heavy coat when it’s a little too hot is only a minor inconvenience for a couple of hours. Usually it pays off later when the sun goes down or the weather becomes unpredictable. Or if it doesn’t, I’ll take the coat off when I arrive at wherever I need to go. The way Halina talks, it’s as if I’m sitting in a restaurant with my hood up – which is not the case. Those coats aren’t an inconvenience to me, but the opposite. Even in summer I can’t leave the house without a heavy coat: I just feel naked. Buying some lighter jackets, like Halina suggests, is just a waste of money because I either wear one of my heavy coats on top, or nothing at all. I suppose my love of heavy coats has become something of a running joke to my friends, but I don’t really care. I’ll arrive to brunch and there’ll be jokes. Halina will ask me whether I’m looking for a polar bear, or working a ski season. I just laugh and say: “Whatever, guys. I’m cosy.” The irony is that I’ve seen Halina in beer gardens shivering at the end of a night out, because she hasn’t properly prepared her own outerwear. I’d rather be a little too hot than too cold for hours, so I’ll always leave the house with one of my big coats unless it’s a heatwave. I can’t see that changing, so my friends, including Halina, will just have to get used to it. It’s not like I’m making them wear the jacket themselves, so why are they so bothered?",innocent,high
"Mum says stealing expensive candles and bath salts from my room is a ‘perk of the landlord’ I’m 22 and live at home with my parents. I’m lucky to be living for almost free (I pay very little in rent) but I struggle when my mum, Doreen, uses my luxury items. When I was living in a shared house at uni I bought a lot of decorative pieces to freshen up the place and spent a small fortune on designer candles and incense. I found university quite stressful, so investing in my surroundings and buying nice things helped me relax. When I moved back home, I took my remaining collection with me, only to find that my mum wanted to use everything. She made fun of me initially, but now she won’t stop lighting the incense and the candles. I didn’t mind at first, but I reckon taking my most expensive candles from my room to use elsewhere when I’m not around is a bit cheeky. I work as a receptionist and the hours are long. When I get home, I like to unwind with a film and some candles in my room, but sometimes I find mum has taken them. She once nicked my most expensive Jo Malone candle and lit it while she was in the bath. Another time I got back from a weekend away and my favourite, Pomegranate Noir, had almost burned to the bottom. I told her to replace it but she just laughed and said using my candles was a “perk of the landlord”. I’d like Mum to leave the things I’ve bought for myself to me Amber When I first moved back I left some candles in the shared spaces for everyone, because I had loads to spare. But they were used up quickly and mum moved on to pinching ones from my room. When I’ve complained she’s said: “Oh well, you’re not paying much rent.” But that shouldn’t mean I’m on candle duty for the rest of my life. Mum has also taken to sprinkling a load of my bath salts in her bath. I wouldn’t mind but she always goes for my favourite ones, the lavender scent that helps you sleep. My dad doesn’t really get involved but he did once say that we shouldn’t be arguing over “all that expensive smelly stuff”. I’d like mum to leave the things I’ve bought for myself to me. They are my small pleasures, so I don’t think I’m being unreasonable in wanting to set boundaries.","Amber can only afford posh candles because we barely charge her rent – why can’t she share them? Amber likes the finer things in life and she’s always been that way. Even though she didn’t grow up with luxury items, she’s found her way to them. She saves up money to spend on tiny designer bags and overpriced jewellery. She also got into candles and incense. The only reason she can afford to indulge in fancy candles is because my husband and I barely charge her rent – about £200 a month, a bargain. If she was out in the real world, there’s no doubt she’d have to stop buying all this stuff. Financially, I’m doing her a favour, so she shouldn’t get so heated up about me burning some overpriced scented candles on a Friday. Whenever Amber has become annoyed at me for taking things from her bedroom, I have mentioned that she could buy some nice things for the house so I wouldn’t have to go to her room. She obliged but I found that the candles she set aside for us weren’t the best. She reserves the really nice ones for herself. I must admit I did revert to pinching the good ones from her room again. I’ve just used a bit of her incense and burned a few candles. Is that so bad? Doreen Amber noticed I’d used her Jo Malone candle when she was away and she was rather annoyed. I did apologise but I also think it’s not that big a deal. I agree that boundaries are necessary in a shared home but I do think I respect them. I do her washing and help her out with money. And it’s not like I’m rifling through her things when she’s out. I’ve just used a bit of her incense and burned a few candles. Is that so bad? I’ve also taken to bathing since Amber moved back in and introduced these lovely bath salts to the house. If she didn’t want me to get into all this, she shouldn’t have shown me. Now it’s hard to go back. The salts really do feel like a lovely treat after a long day. I could buy my own, of course, but it’s better when Amber picks them out. I never know which brands to buy. Amber buys nice things for herself quite regularly, so really, she should share them with her family. With the money she saves on rent, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask her to be on candle and bath salt duty while she’s under my roof.",guilty,medium
"I want a garden. Leo says we’d get more for our money without one, and in a cheaper area My older brother, Leo, and I are buying a house together, but it’s starting to get complicated. Initially we thought it was a great idea; we’d inherited some money from our grandparents and wanted to invest in something long-term. We both live in London and neither of us can afford to buy alone . I’m a teacher and Leo is a plumber. With him being self-employed it was a bit harder to find a mortgage, but we managed it. We started looking at two-bedroom properties four months ago, and agreed on an area that would work for us both. But then Leo got it into his head that he wanted to buy somewhere else, where the properties are cheaper. I wanted a garden, but Leo said we’d get more for our money if we didn’t have one, especially in a cheaper area. I really hate the place he is suggesting, but he won’t listen. He started saying we were “buying above our means”. He’s five years older and can be quite domineering, but this house-buying plan was my idea. I was the one who contacted mortgage brokers and got all the papers ready. Leo is now talking about the ‘options’ we have and says one day he might buy me out The initial plan was for me to share the property with a flatmate or friend (and for Leo to live elsewhere, but be paid rent to help cover his portion of the mortgage). But Leo now has a girlfriend and is talking about living in the property one day. We’ve agreed to discuss it in five years, but who knows where we’ll be then? He’s now talking about the “options” we have and says it’s possible that one day he might buy me out. I know Leo wouldn’t let me make any terrible financial decisions, but I don’t want to be bulldozed. Leo is putting in more of the deposit; I think that’s why he sees himself as the main decision-maker, but that’s not really fair. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by all the decisions and wonder if it’s worth it. Especially as things are getting so crazy with the UK mortgage market. Leo needs to let me have more of a say, as I’m the one who will be living in it, and this is one of the biggest decisions of our lives.","Mortgage rates are rising so sharply that I reckon it’s smart to go as cheap as possible Isobel and I want to get serious about our finances, so we thought it would be a good idea to go halves on a property. I still think it’s a good idea; we just seem to have different ideas about what to do. As I don’t plan to live there, the house is more of an investment opportunity for me at the moment. Isobel thinks that means I shouldn’t have as much of a say as her, but I disagree. I’m five years older and a bit more cautious when it comes to investing, but I’m also putting in £10,000 more of the deposit than her. Technically, that means I should have a larger stake in the property, but I’m fine with just splitting everything down the middle with ownership. The government has royally screwed over our generation in terms of house ownership I started out by thinking somewhere bigger with a garden was a good idea, but after looking at the market, I reckon it’s smart to go as cheap as possible. Isobel doesn’t agree because she loves having a garden, but we have to be realistic. Mortgage rates are rising rapidly and we need to make savings wherever possible. Forgoing a garden means we can buy a cheaper property. I appreciate Isobel doing the research in terms of finding a mortgage broker, but I do my bit too. I’m self-employed, which means I’m more flexible with viewings, so I take the reins there. I don’t think I’m too overbearing though. I have a girlfriend now and Isobel thinks the reason I’m changing my mind is because I want to move into the property with her in the future, but that’s not true. We’re not really there yet. This flat with Isobel is an investment; I’m just cautious about making the wrong decision. The government has royally screwed over our generation in terms of house ownership. Buying with my sister isn’t ideal, and there might be some problems in the future if one of us wants to sell before the other, but we’ve agreed to review this in five years and see where we are then. Isobel just needs to listen to my advice and realise that I’m trying to help us both do something that will benefit us in the long run.",guilty,high
"Since moving overseas, Niamh has got even more scatty and keeps missing our planned calls My best mate Niamh moved abroad a while ago and has become terrible at staying in touch. It’s starting to affect our friendship. We met at university and have known each other for almost 12 years. Before she moved, we lived in the same city and saw each other regularly, almost every weekend. I’ve always joked that she’s a bit scatty, the sort of person who is late for everything and often loses things, and she knows that. That’s just Niamh. But now she’s abroad she struggles to stick to scheduled calls. I’ve lost track of the number of times we’ve made a plan to speak and Niamh is 30 minutes late, or doesn’t appear at all The other week, a few friends and I arranged a big Zoom call for the birthday of a mutual friend who also lives abroad. Everyone had been notified of it weeks before. But Niamh forgot and didn’t join the call until it was almost over. She missed the games and the happy birthday song. She claimed that she’d got confused with the time zones, but she had been abroad almost eight months by that point. I think that’s a poor excuse. She has messed up a few of our calls too, and we don’t speak as much as we used to. I’ve lost track of the number of times we have made a plan to speak at a certain time and she is 30 minutes late – or just doesn’t appear at all. Often I’m left waiting, or she only comes online after I’ve messaged her on Zoom, Facebook, WhatsApp and email. And when she is on the phone, there’s a chance she will disappear mid-call. Once I was in the middle of a rant about my boss and the phone suddenly went dead. She didn’t try to ring back. The next day I asked what happened and she blamed her internet VPN, but she could have sent a text. Maybe it’s teething problems because we’re getting used to being in different countries, but I do find myself losing patience. Niamh suggested sending each other voice notes, but it’s harder to keep track of updates that way. You send a few, the other person sends a few a week later, and by that point you’ve forgetten what you originally said. Also where does it end? Do you voicenote forever? I prefer the immediacy and clarity of calling.","I’m several time zones away, so it’s easy to get a bit lost. Martha should stop being so touchy I don’t think I’m quite as bad as Martha is making out. I’m very active when it comes to messaging people on WhatsApp – and I even arranged for some flowers to be sent to Martha on her birthday. I just sometimes get a bit lost in all these diarised calls, especially now that we are a few hours apart. I really value Martha’s friendship but we are living very different lives now, thousands of miles away from each other. I think it’s only natural that we don’t speak as much. If I’ve forgotten a call, Martha will message me on about five different platforms until she gets a response WhatsApp calls are banned where I live, and that’s how everyone calls each other in the UK. So naturally, we have to make some changes to how we communicate. The time I missed our friend’s Zoom wasn’t that big a deal – I made it for the last five minutes. And it only happened because I’d only recently moved and was still adjusting to the time difference. I also think Martha and I have different personalities. She will remember all the times I was late to a planned call, but not all the times I have reached out to her to arrange a call myself. If I’ve forgotten a call, Martha will message me on about five different platforms until she gets a response and then, when she is on the phone, she will be in a huff for about five minutes, telling me that my time isn’t more important than hers. I agree of course, but I’ll only have made a simple mistake. The time she was offloading to me about her job and my phone cut out due to my VPN, she was annoyed at me for a week afterwards. I think that’s a bit over the top. We are too old to be having petty arguments, especially as we don’t see each other in person. If I miss a call or I’m late to a Zoom, I will apologise and then I want to move on. Life is too short. I can try and be more organised but I think Martha and I should send each other voice notes more to alleviate the stress of booking calls. It seems easier and more flexible. That way we can stay in touch without the pressure.",innocent,medium
"Tolu’s diet takes over the whole kitchen – and it’s having a negative effect on my own Tolu, my housemate and friend, takes his fitness very seriously. Some might say he’s a bit obsessed. He goes to the gym six or seven days a week and is extremely vigilant about his diet. This is fine as long as it doesn’t affect the people around him, but in our flat it sometimes does. Tolu orders his food from bodybuilder sites – huge boxes of bland protein wraps, bags of flavourless carb-free noodles and loads of other things I don’t understand. These are all stored in our kitchen or, if space runs out, the living room. There are about seven bags of whey protein stashed beside the fridge. If we want to cook anything at the weekend we have to wait for him to finish Cooking is really difficult because I can’t find my stuff. Previously, each housemate had an allocated space for our food, but now Tolu has taken most of it up. You have to move all the bodybuilder items around to get to your own section of the cupboard or fridge. Tolu also cooks a lot. At weekends he’ll batch-cook meals for the week. This can take hours and involves an elaborate process of boiling chickens, peeling and roasting loads of vegetables and placing everything in 15 plastic containers, which then take up half the fridge. It’s all very dull, but each to their own I guess. If we want to cook at the weekend we have to wait for him to finish. The kitchen is small, so we can’t share it, and he’ll be in there for hours. One time Tolu and I had a row because I wanted to cook my dinner and he said “sorry the oven is full for the next few hours. I’m slow-roasting a chicken.” I thought it was a bit selfish. He realised the error of his ways and made room for me that night, thankfully, but it was a bit annoying. I also had to postpone a dinner party once because Tolu was still cooking. He can be in there for six hours sometimes, and if he starts at 4pm, that’s blocking prime cooking time for the rest of us. I’ve ended up eating more takeaways at the weekend than I’d like, because I can’t be bothered to wait for Tolu. He’s a sound housemate but he could give us a bit of warning when he plans to take up the kitchen for hours – or move on from his batch-cooked life.","I use the kitchen once a week to batch-cook – Rick could learn a thing or two about healthy eating My housemates Rick and Jack know I’m pretty big into my fitness.

I go to the gym almost every day and I used to compete in bodybuilding competitions, which meant I had to go through a rigorous cycle of bulking (gaining muscle) and cutting (losing fat). My diet would change all the time, and to stay organised and focused, I just learned to cook in bulk and prep for the week. I don’t compete in competitions any more, but I still enjoy maintaining my physique. You don’t make bad food choices in the week if you have a box of nutritionally balanced food ready to eat I buy most of my food in bulk from bodybuilding sites because they include extra protein and nutrients. Rick complains that the boxes of food take up a lot of space but I don’t think it’s too bad. I stack boxes on top of each other, and if there’s space on the shelves or in the fridge then of course I’ll put stuff there too. Rick and Jack never seem to cook in bulk or watch what they eat. There’s always free space in their allocated storage places. Why shouldn’t I use it? It goes to waste otherwise. Related: You be the judge: should my influencer flatmate stop filling our flat with freebies? The lads laugh at me for spending six hours cooking my food on a Sunday, but it keeps me focused and disciplined. You don’t make bad food choices in the week if you have a box of nutritionally balanced food ready to eat. Removing the temptation to buy a processed lunch when I’m out is good for me. The boys should try it. Rick especially eats a lot of takeaways. He blames it on me and says it is because he can’t get in the kitchen, but no one forces him to place the order. The boys also know that I always cook at a certain time on a Sunday, so I don’t think they can complain too much – it’s only once a week and the rest of the time the kitchen is free. I always clean up after myself. Sometimes I can be there for half a day, and Rick and I did have a little tiff one time because I was taking up the whole oven to cook a chicken, but I made room for him and it was fine. The guys should take a leaf out of my book and get organised and disciplined with their eating habits, because I’m not going to tone down mine.",guilty,high
"Akash will wear colourful Crocs with vibrant socks and call it ‘a look’. But I really detest it Akash, my boyfriend of two years, is not the shy and retiring type. He’s always been that way and I do love him for it. When Akash walks into a room you notice him. He’s a big personality and his dress sense reflects that. When we first got together, I noticed his flair with fashion straight away. He’d wear shirts that were bright and patterned and pair them with colourful trainers. We are almost 30 and he’s becoming increasingly eccentric. Akash is now really into Crocs and has them in about 10 different colours. He doesn’t wear them on formal occasions but if we go for dinner in a chilled place, he will think nothing of wearing them with vibrant socks. He even tried to wear Crocs to my sister’s graduation meal. I had to put my foot down. I pointed out that my family would be dressed up and that he needed to make more of an effort. He was fine with that, thankfully. There have been a few other occasions when we’ve been getting ready for a date or a friend’s birthday and I’ve tried to gently steer him away from Crocs, as I really detest them. Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose. I prefer a cleaner, more simple look on Akash. I dress quite minimalist myself. He owns cream and orange-patterned cargo pants, which I hate. I always say “not those trousers again” when I see them. He just laughs, pairs them with Crocs and yellow socks and calls it “a look”. We first met during lockdown when he would wear smart trousers, a shirt and trainers. Now it’s Crocs with everything We met during lockdown, when we were adjusting to working from home. We’d meet for a walk around a park or for a drink and he would wear a nice Parka, smart trousers, a shirt and trainers. He liked getting changed to meet me. Now it’s Crocs with everything and oversized graphic T-shirts. There’s no differentiation between what he wears when working from home and what he wears on date nights. I think it’s nice to get changed out of your work clothes and go out in something else, but Akash disagrees.","I love my eccentric colour palette and wearing what I want. The Crocs are going nowhere I know that Priya doesn’t love my fashion sense, but I think it’s kind of funny. She really dislikes my Crocs, but they aren’t going anywhere. They are an absolute staple. I got into wearing them when I first started working from home. Crocs are comfortable, lightweight, affordable and go with anything. I’m a graphic designer and so spend all day drawing and working on projects. I have always loved experimenting with colour and style and am quite a creative person. When I met Priya two years ago, I was doing graphic design on the side, while I worked in recruitment. My job dictated my style: I was dressing more formally, with less colour. But now I’m a full-time designer, I’m far happier and can also wear what I want. I love finding vintage shirts from charity shops and wearing patterned, clashing colours. Being fully home-based, I don’t see the need for formal wear I love finding vintage shirts from charity shops and wearing patterned, clashing colours. Being fully home-based now, I don’t see the need for any formal wear. Working in an office really cramped my style – I wasn’t comfortable in shirts and shoes. Now I can wear my graphic T-shirts, tracksuit bottoms and Crocs all day. Priya thinks when we are going out on dates I should smarten up, but the best part about working from home is there’s no need to change after work. I understand that there are occasions when I’d need to look a bit smarter, and of course I’m open to that. But I’m not a slob, I’m just a bit eccentric with my colour palette – and allergic to smart trousers. Priya once got annoyed at me when I tried to wear Crocs to her sister’s graduation meal. It wasn’t an argument but she did say “I think you should change,” and so I did. Her parents were there in suits and her sister was in a smart dress, so maybe Crocs wouldn’t have been the right vibe. But on a day-to-day basis, I love wearing eye-catching casual clothes. That’s my personal style and Priya needs to accept it. Life is way too short to confine yourself to outfits that are uncomfortable and don’t reflect who you are.",innocent,medium
"Using the sink strainer is simple and could prevent a big plumbing hassle I live with my husband, Simeon, in a house that has a sink strainer, which I think is quite useful. It helps with collecting any sort of food debris and, for me, it’s just an obvious thing to use. I’ve always had one in my home. But Simeon doesn’t feel that way. We’ve had this little running kitchen battle in the three years we’ve been married and lived together – . I put the sink strainer in the plug, and he takes it out. Round and round we go. I get irritated and so does he. Simeon thinks the sink strainer is annoying and useless. He says it doesn’t really have a function, that the sink and the pipes will actually take food and coffee grounds without any problem. But I think coffee grains and oats should never go down the sink. Simeon says we should just let small food particles flow down the sink. His stance assumes you don’t clear out the strainer on a regular basis He also says that, because we live in a hot climate in Australia, if food is left in the sink strainer, cockroaches or other insects may come along and cause problems. I kind of agree with that. I don’t want more cockroaches around our home. But obviously, that stance assumes that you don’t clear out the strainer on a regular basis. I would say I take the food out of the strainer three to five times a day. I clean it out and put the food remains in the bin. It takes about 10 seconds. For me it’s not overly onerous but Simeon says it’s a waste of time and an unnecessary action. Simeon did say that, if the sink clogs up, he will pay for a plumber. But I think that’s silly and extravagant. We have antiquated plumbing from the 1970s so I am worried that his habits will make things worse. And surely prevention is better than cure? If we have a sink strainer what’s the point in not using it and spending money on a problem that we could avoid?","Our pipes are big enough to cope with coffee grounds getting washed down the plughole Leaving the sink strainer in the sink is annoying. It reminds me of the times I lived in a shared house and I had a flatmate who left the washing up in the sink. If I want to wash coffee grounds down the sink or something similar, I need to remove it first. I don’t like having to deal with the food in the strainer before I can do my thing. The default function of a sink is to have an open drain. Things should just flow down whenever it is necessary. I see the strainer as totally devoid of purpose. I think the main disagreement between me and Clara is where we leave the strainer We also have a dishwasher, but I think rinsing things in the sink so that it prevents the dishwasher from clogging up makes more sense than trying to prevent the sink clogging up. The sink is designed to carry small bits of food away, whereas the dishwasher isn’t and has an in-built strainer. I think the main disagreement between me and Clara is where we leave the strainer. She likes it in the sink, whereas I would prefer it to be left outside the sink so you could just use the sink to rinse things down. The sinks where we live have drains that are 65-75mm wide. Basically anything that goes through that has been fine. Anything small enough – oats from porridge, muesli, small food particles, coffee grounds – it’s fine. Clara hates that I let all that stuff go down our sink, but we’ve had no problems so far. I’ve spoken to plumbers and they affirm my stance: small food bits won’t clog our drains, but fats and oils will. I never put those down the sink. Clara is super tidy, probably tidier than me. We both keep the kitchen clean, we just disagree on this strainer issue. I think it should sit outside the sink unless she wants to use it and we should keep our sink in its default natural state. It’s all pretty simple in my mind.",guilty,medium
"I know Linda is stressed, but she should get into the summer spirit with me and the kids I love my wife, Linda, but when summer comes and things get hot, I think she gets a little stressed with our kids. We’re in the middle of a heatwave and while my two young daughters, Ethel and Mabel, and I love it and want to spend time outside in our garden, Linda complains. I think a nice summer in the UK is cause for celebration. After work I love to come home and play with the kids in our garden. Sometimes that means a water fight. I taught them how to fill up balloons and bought them water pistols, but Linda wasn’t a fan. She said that I’m teaching them how to be rough and that water fights make too much of a mess. I told her to relax – it’s summer. I think the girls should be able to make the most of their time outdoors. It’s so much better than them playing on their iPads inside. I tell her I’ll clean up any mess, but Linda always moans anyway Recently the girls wanted to get the paddling pool out and Linda wouldn’t let them. She says it is a waste of water, which is true, but we only fill it up once a year and reuse the water. Linda says the water gets dirty easily and also worries about the girls getting sunburned if they are outside too long. Sometimes she will complain about them dripping water inside the house. I am the more hands-on parent and don’t mind about all that stuff. I tell her I’ll do the bed and bath routine with the girls and clean up any mess, but Linda moans anyway. Linda is great with the housework and cooking and is a full-time stay-at-home mum, but sometimes I think she needs to let her hair down and be a bit more playful. I do think the hot weather is the main thing getting to her. She says, “I’m too hot – I can’t concentrate on anything,” as soon as the temperature gets over 25C. Linda should try to get into the summer spirit with me and the kids. I know she spends all day in the house, which can be tough, whereas I come back from work and probably get the best of the good times with the girls. Even so, if she relaxed a bit over the paddling pool and the hot weather, that would be nice for all of us.","Related: You be the judge: does my sister really need five milk alternatives open at once? Playtime can get a bit rowdy. I worry about the neighbours – and wasting that much water Summer is great if you are young and child-free, but we are not any more. Of course I love my girls, but during a heatwave the stress of staying at home all day with them definitely gets a little more intense. Roy doesn’t see what goes on in the day, when I’m the carer. When it’s hot, school will occasionally finish early, so I’ll have to be at home with our daughters. They are really hyperactive in this heat. Ethel always moans about being uncomfortable and sweaty, and Mabel constantly begs for ice-cream. I try to keep them busy with iPad games and language lessons. I think it’s good to have them focused on productive things. But then Roy comes home at 5pm and wants to get them completely hyped up again in the garden. He is super playful, which I love, but being in the garden every day creates extra mess and I like to keep a tidy home. After one dip it’s filled with muck from the girls’ feet, which is really unhygienic I don’t have a problem with the odd water fight, but Roy will go nuts and let the girls fill up multiple ballooons, and I worry about disturbing the neighbours. I also think the paddling pool is a bad idea. I don’t care if it’s 30C – we shouldn’t be wasting that much water. Plus, after one dip it’s filled with soil and muck from the girls’ feet, which makes it really unhygienic. I sound like a misery guts, but I just prefer organised fun for my kids: card games, online entertainment, reading. We live in a cul-de-sac in a small town. Everyone knows everyone, and I don’t need my kids shouting and screaming outside until it’s time for bed. When summer comes, it seems that all routine and discipline go out the window. Often the girls don’t want to go to sleep if they’ve been playing all evening with Roy in the garden. I don’t want to play bad cop all the time, but I seem to be. Roy needs to see things from my perspective. I am at home all day with the kids. I have a good routine for them during the summer holidays, and although I love that he wants to play with Ethel and Mabel after work, it should be more contained – and the water fights need to stop.",guilty,high
"Brushing after breakfast makes sense – why start your day with crumbs stuck in your teeth? My wife, Wanda, believes you should brush your teeth before breakfast. But I think you should eat first, then brush it all away after breakfast. After you wake up, there’s a lot of bacteria between your teeth. I have told Wanda this over the years (diplomatically of course) that she’s in the wrong, but she won’t change. You are leaving food particles between your teeth for hours. I don’t think her method makes a whole lot of sense Usually the question about who’s right doesn’t come up. But recently I read an article saying that her method of brushing before breakfast is better for good dental hygiene. The article said brushing before breakfast coats your teeth in toothpaste and offers protection against food and sugar for the rest of the day. But I feel that this benefit is far outweighed by the fact that food would be sitting in your mouth all day. You are leaving food particles between your teeth for hours, after all. I don’t think her method makes sense. I have said to her: “I don’t know how you cope with the food between your teeth all day. Aren’t you worried?” And she will say no – it’s just how she was raised. For Wanda it’s a cultural thing. If you’re brought up to do a certain thing, whatever culture you’re in, you’re immune to reason. It’s now part of her morning ritual. I don’t think culture is necessarily open to scientific fact or better ideas. It creates habits that are hard to break. When I’ve had that experience of not brushing my teeth after breakfast, it’s a physically uncomfortable feeling. A few times I’ve woken up late, eaten something quickly and then forgotten to brush my teeth because I’m doing something else, and I hate the way my mouth feels. My teeth seem to have a film on them. And there’s always this chunk of food stuck in my molar and my tongue is vigorously trying to get that thing out for hours and hours. I’m not sure how Wanda copes. Fortunately, Wanda and I live in a house with two bathrooms, so I don’t have to put up with the sight of her brushing her teeth before breakfast. When you live with someone, you make certain compromises.","I was taught that you wake up, have a wash and clean your teeth – the issue is a cultural one When I was young, my parents always said that when you wake up, you should brush your teeth, wash your face and freshen up. It gives you that instant energy after being asleep. So that’s why I always brush my teeth before breakfast. It’s a habit I’ve had for many years. I was taught that when you wake up and wash immediately, you become a different person – you get rid of the night. It’s what I’m used to. I’m of a Chinese background and my husband’s American. We’ve just been taught by our parents to do different things. If I brush my teeth after breakfast I’ll taste toothpaste on the way to work. That leaves a horrible flavour for hours Brushing my teeth before breakfast also saves time. I tried Alex’s method before, but because I have to leave for work straight after I finish my breakfast, I don’t want to go back upstairs to brush. It takes up too much time. So I quit that habit very quickly. Now after breakfast I’m quickly out of the door to start the commute. If I brush my teeth after breakfast I also find it annoying because I’ll taste toothpaste on the way to work and that leaves a horrible flavour in my mouth for hours. I really don’t like it. Alex and I both have very good teeth – people tell us this regularly. We should both carry on doing what we are doing. It’s interesting because in China some things are typically taken very seriously, such as your skin, but there is not so much emphasis on your teeth. Compared with the US, it’s a lot less common to see a dentist regularly and spend money on braces. A lot of my friends say, “Wow your teeth are so good.” But I had braces and I take very good care of my teeth. I brush them twice a day like most people, and I also floss. Related: You be the judge: should my fellow bridesmaid dial down the hen-do plans? Obviously my methods are working and I’m happy about that. I haven’t read the article Alex was talking about, but I don’t need to. Everyone has their own choice and I like mine. If he thinks that it’s healthy to brush his teeth after eating, he can do it. I will continue to brush my teeth in this way, and that’s fine.",innocent,medium
"Our friend wants a tropical hen do, but Katie seems to have no regard for how expensive it all is One of my friends, Alisee, recently got engaged. Even though she’s not getting married for another year and a half, the preparations have already begun. It’s all we ever talk about. I’m a bridesmaid, along with my good friend Katie. I was pleased to be asked, but I’ve found that Katie is really enthusiastic about bridesmaid duties whereas I’m more apprehensive. Katie has made a WhatsApp group for all us bridesmaids and keeps hyping Alisee’s ideas up, even when they are ridiculous. I’m not sure I can keep this up for another 18 months. From the minute Alisee got engaged, Katie has taken it upon herself to explain the bridesmaid duties to us in minute detail. She said we have to start preparations for the hen do immediately, and calls monthly bridesmaids meetings to plan it all. We have to collect money from Alisee’s friends to fund the hen do, too. Perhaps it’s because I’m single, but I just can’t imagine ever acting the same way For the trip, Alisee wants a tropical location with a villa, butler service, loads of activities, a spa day and a night out. Katie has agreed to it all, and made it worse by suggesting we get personalised robes. I’ve told Katie to calm it down, as it’s going to take a lot of money and time. But Katie thinks it is all totally acceptable. How can I be expected to get all this done on top of my job? I’m also not sure I can afford it. I don’t earn as much as some of the others. We’re a tight-knit group of friends. Katie has been married for years and I think the reason she’s so happy to appease Alisee is because she was a bit of a bridezilla herself. At her wedding, Katie changed the bridesmaid dresses at the last minute and put us in ones that we all hated. Related: You be the judge: tell us about your domestic disputes Perhaps it’s because I’m one of the few single friends in the group, but I can’t imagine acting the same way. Alisee also wants us to pay for our bridesmaid dresses, which Katie says is “totally normal”.I’ve suggested to Katie that we arrange a meeting with Alisee to manage expectations and costs. But Katie thinks that will ruin Alisee’s high. She said, “We’ll probably only get married once: we have to do this for our best friend.” But I don’t want to speak to Alisee alone, and would like the backing of my friend. It would be good to get together and say something before it gets out of hand.","Steph needs to step up for her best friend – a girl’s wedding is the most important day of her life My philosophy is that a girl’s wedding is the most important day of her life. We need to be there as much as possible for Alisee because she will only do this once. Perhaps it’s because I’ve been through it myself, but I don’t think Alisee’s demands are crazy. It’s just what you do when you get married; you distribute responsibilities among your bridesmaids, and ask them to plan your hen. Steph and I are leading this. The WhatsApp group helped get things in order from the very start. We have to plan the hen do in advance because things will get booked up. That’s just how it works. I’m supporting Alisee and suggesting additions that will make the hen do extra special, like professional catering and a lovely villa with a pool. Steph is being a bit negative and saying that it’s all too expensive, but most of these demands are coming from the bride, not me. I just want to do the best job possible for Alisee. It’s like a fun little club, and it’s all about celebrating your friend Steph was initially onboard with all my plans but now she’s saying things like: “Do we have to keep messaging about drinking games when it’s more than a year away?” She doesn’t even really reply to a lot of the group chat any more. I’m worried she will be totally out of the loop by the time the hen do rolls around. It’s a bit concerning. I think that being a bridesmaid is so rewarding. You get to be front and centre at a loved one’s wedding and you can make the hen do really special. Usually you get to stay with the wedding party the night before. It’s like a fun little club celebrating your friend. When Alisee asked us both to be bridesmaids, I was really excited. I think, initially, Steph was too, but now the reality of what we have to do has sunk in and she’s getting a bit nervous. I understand that Steph isn’t as well-off as some of us, but I think if we just treat the hen do abroad as a girls’ holiday, it will be fine. We would have spent that money on another trip anyway. I don’t want to rain on Alisee’s parade and tell her to tone down her requests as I don’t think they are that extreme. Steph just needs to get over the psychological barrier of it and step up for her best friend.",guilty,high
"No one needs that many consoles. We don’t have enough room and he rarely uses one of them When Max and I moved into our flat together two years ago, he brought two games consoles. I said: “This is a bit weird, why do you need an Xbox One and an Xbox 360? Are we going to have space?” He said he needed both, as some of his games can only be played on one of the consoles . We don’t have much room in our small flat. We have a TV stand with three rectangular dividers the size of a DVD box; I said fine, we could fit his two consoles there. The third divider holds our wifi router. I didn’t want to stop his gaming – I actually quite like joining in sometimes. I don’t want the flat looking messy, or like one big gaming room Then I realised the only reason he was keeping his Xbox 360 was to play one game, Guitar Hero . I love Guitar Hero, it’s a classic, but I told Max, “If you’re keeping this console just for one game, you’d better play it.” And in the two years we’ve lived together he has only played it twice. It is even more annoying because the game comes with guitar-like controllers we have to store in our cupboard. Now Max wants a third console – a PlayStation 5 or new Xbox, I can’t even remember. But where will it live? Max suggested keeping it on the floor, but I don’t want the flat looking messy, or like one big gaming room. I also think it is ridiculous to own three consoles; it’s so indulgent. Related: You be the judge: should my wife stop walking off when we argue? We have reached deadlock. I said, “You don’t play the old Xbox 360 enough to justify getting another.” But then Max got funny about chucking it out. He is a bit of a hoarder. Whenever I suggest having a clear-out he stops me and says we can find a home for something and we might need it again. I think threatening to throw out his Xbox 360 is tapping into his anxiety. But I am already being lenient by allowing two consoles. In my mind, the only way to make space for a new one is to throw an old one out, especially since he has only used one of them twice in two years. Finally, Max needs to make sure he justifies the price of a new console by choosing games he will play regularly. Otherwise, I’m putting my foot down.","What if I want to play the old console on a whim some day? It brings me so much joy Bryony says we don’t need three consoles, but how much space does a console really take up? They are only small; they can fit in anywhere and we have a TV stand with slots. Besides, certain games are only available on certain consoles, so it makes sense to keep them all. I have the Xbox 360, which is about 10 years old, then the Xbox One, which is a bit newer. Now all these new-generation consoles are coming out and I’d like to keep up with the latest trends. And of course I’ll keep the ones I have. Xbox 360 games are great. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and a few others only work on this console. Why would I throw them all away? Before I moved in with Bryony, I had the Xbox 360 in my bedroom and the Xbox One downstairs – my flatmates and I played on that together. It was good to have two in a shared flat. If someone wanted to watch TV downstairs, I’d go to my room to game. I like the idea of holding on to things for sentimental reasons Now it’s just Bryony and me, we keep both consoles in the living room. She says there isn’t space for a third but I disagree. Our place is always tidy, but Bryony is obsessed with decluttering. I don’t think we have that much stuff to begin with. I’ve always lived in big, shared houses and every time I’ve moved I have brought the same belongings with me. I’m not used to analysing every item and chucking stuff out. Maybe I’m lazy. Bryony used to say, “Why would you bother keeping this?” about a book or old jumper, but I like holding on to things for sentimental reasons. Bryony and I play games together now and again, but she doesn’t think I can justify getting a third console because I don’t have the time. She is probably right, but even if I haven’t touched the old Xbox 360 for years, it is worth holding on to. What if I want to play on it on a whim someday? It brings me so much joy – who cares how often I play it? Besides, we’re planning to move soon, and I intend to find a space for that third console and maybe even a games room. Bryony will have to come around to it.",innocent,medium
"Luna is always on our mattress at night, and I think it’s gross. She’s got a dog bed downstairs I’ve just bought a house and my girlfriend Tilda stays over most nights with her little dog, Luna. I like Luna a lot. She’s a Jack Russell terrier and very friendly. She is allowed anywhere in the house – except, if I had it my way, the bed. Tilda disagrees. I haven’t had a chance to buy a bed frame since moving in, and Luna regularly gets on our mattress at night. We keep a little cushion dog bed in the corner of the bedroom and a crate for her downstairs, but Tilda is reluctant to leave her down there. Tilda says, ‘Oh Luna’s no hassle, you won’t even notice she’s there’ Tilda says: “Luna’s no hassle, you won’t even notice she’s there.” But during the night the dog will come and sit on your chest and lick your face, before falling asleep on you, which is too much. Of course you notice when a dog is breathing in your face. I find it harder to sleep because I’m conscious of her there. There’s also the hygiene issue – even though Luna is short-haired and doesn’t shed much, she’s still a dog. It’s gross to think of the germs on her claws rubbing off on us and our sheets. When Tilda and I first got together two years ago, I was living with my parents and Tilda with her mum. When Tilda came to spend time with me she didn’t bring Luna over as much, as my parents had their house rules. We couldn’t have the dog upstairs, so Luna stayed in her crate. But now I’ve bought a house and Tilda and Luna are staying over, all the rules seem to have gone out the window. Now Luna’s gotten into the habit of sleeping with us, it’s hard to get her out of it. I have tried putting my foot down recently, putting her in the crate before bed myself, but she just whines until Tilda asks if we can go to get her and ends up in our bed. It’s a vicious cycle, and has affected my sleep. Tilda needs to be stricter with Luna. It’s her dog, so she needs to put a plan in place so we can all get a good night’s sleep. Tilda is hoping to move in full-time soon but unless we get this issue sorted, I can’t see it working out with the three of us under one roof. A dog’s place is in its own bed, not in the bed of its owner.","If Ronnie doesn’t like Luna on the bed, he should buy a bed frame to stop her jumping up I got Luna in lockdown when I was single and living alone in France. She was my companion, my rock during hard times. I moved back to the UK and met Ronnie two years ago. Luna has always slept in my bed or in my room, so it’s hard to train her out of it. Ronnie does love Luna. She’s a gorgeous little pooch; sociable, kind and loving and she even responds to his commands. It’s just the sleeping that is the issue. I actually like having her snuggled up beside us in bed but Ronnie thinks it’s gross. However, I always make sure Luna is super clean and bathe her regularly. She certainly doesn’t have fleas, so I’m not sure why he’s concerned about that. Luna also doesn’t really shed her hair, and I brush her teeth. I’d love to have her inside the duvet with us more often, but Ronnie doesn’t really allow it. Luna’s pleas pull at my heartstrings, so I usually just cave in Occasionally she will stay in her bed in the corner of our bedroom but I don’t really like putting her in the crate downstairs as she whines. Ronnie says if I stick to it she will get used to it, but her whimpering pulls at my heartstrings, so I usually cave in and let her back up into our room after about an hour. Once she’s in our room, she’s as good as gold. The main reason Luna hops up on the “bed” is because we are really still sleeping on a mattress the floor. Ronnie has yet to get a bed frame – he says he hasn’t gotten around to it but it’s already been five months. It might remove temptation if Ronnie invested in a bed frame that makes it more difficult for Luna to jump up on to. Failing that, I could start training her to sleep away from us more, but I just find it sad as I love having her in the bed with us. I was happy to obey Ronnie’s parents’ rules before, but now I am spending more time at his house, I think he could relax a bit.

I’ll come home from work and the cutlery drawer will be out, the cupboard where we keep the teabags ajar, and the condiments cupboard wide open. It’s a hazard. And aesthetically it makes everything look terrible. I’m only 5ft and the open doors are just the right height to hit my head. I also bang my hips on the drawers. It hurts and could be avoided if Donald just closed them. I’m a bit of a klutz and his habit makes it worse. He says it’s my fault if I walk into things and that I should keep my eyes peeled. But if I’m just back from work and rushing around in the kitchen or trying to make a cup of tea, I don’t always see them. Related: You be the judge: tell us about your domestic disputes Before we moved in together two years ago, Donald lived with housemates. He says that no one ever called him out on it. I think that’s probably because he was always able to blame someone else, but now it’s just the two of us there’s no escape. I noticed his little quirk as soon as we moved in together. The first few times I thought it was me being forgetful but with Donald working from home in lockdown it became obvious who it was. My parents also commented on it when we stayed at their house. They said: “Oh, we can see Donald has been here.” It’s weird. He doesn’t leave wardrobe doors open or the toilet seat up. It’s just in the kitchen I’ve asked him why he leaves all these doors open. He says that he forgets, and he’s going to open the cupboards again 10 minutes later, so why bother closing them. That makes some sense. He makes a lot of tea and gets up regularly – but he should still take more care so I don’t have to close everything. It’s weird. He doesn’t leave wardrobe doors open or the toilet seat up and is also tidier than me in other areas – I have more clothes and leave a lot of stuff hanging around our flat. It’s just in the kitchen. Donald should try harder. It’s an easy win in our relationship. If he can’t manage it, maybe we should get child locks. Or, Donald should keep the tea and coffee on the counter so he won’t have to open that drawer.","I drink a lot of tea and coffee, so I like to keep the cupboard door permanently open I see no issue with leaving kitchen cupboards open. I work from home and get up every 90 minutes to make a cuppa. On an average day I drink three cups of tea, two coffees and (after 9pm) several cups of peppermint tea. It’s more efficient to keep the teabag cupboard open all day. That’s my excuse and I think it’s a valid one. I know it doesn’t take a lot of energy to close the doors and drawers after yourself, but I just don’t think about it when I’m in work mode. After two years of working remotely I’ve got into the habit of leaving things ajar. I can’t help it. I leave the cutlery cupboard open, as well as three cupboards containing condiments and tea and coffee. I also spend more time in the kitchen. I’m the domestic god, while Daisy brings home more of the bacon, so the kitchen is my domain. I should be able to do what I like with it. I don’t believe Daisy’s argument that she’s a klutz and needs help not to bump into things. Her eyesight is better than mine – I wear glasses and she doesn’t. When she’s banged her hip on a drawer I am sympathetic. I will hear a gasp or “ow!” from the kitchen and feel a bit bad. But I don’t think it’s my fault. She should watch where she’s going. If I’ve left a drawer open it’s not to spite her. It’s not my responsibility if she knocks into one. When I go to sleep I close everything else – wardrobe doors, windows, bedroom and bathroom doors. As Daisy says, I’m very tidy. I’m Irish and Daisy is English – maybe it’s a cultural thing as we’re a bit more relaxed. When I told one of my Irish friends about Daisy getting irritated by my forgetfulness, he took a picture of his kitchen with multiple drawers open and said: “Finally, I feel seen. I do it, too.” I don’t agree with the child-lock suggestion. That would feel as if Daisy doesn’t trust me in my own kitchen. I can try harder to close things after myself if it helps Daisy from getting injured. And I like the idea of keeping the coffee and tea out on the counter. But this whole thing is trivial.",guilty,high
"Derek’s phone constantly pings, beeps, chimes and buzzes – and it is driving me bonkers My boyfriend Derek never puts his phone on silent and it drives me up the wall. We’ve recently moved in together after three years of dating and now work remotely in the same flat for most of the week. I noticed it a bit before, but now that we’re living together, it is driving me bonkers. He loves having his phone on full volume all the time. Europe’s The Final Countdown blasts out each time he gets a call, and he has those clanging bells for his app notifications and texts. He takes a lot of calls and I can hear his phone constantly beeping, chiming and buzzing. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes I’ve asked him if he could keep his phone on silent, but he says that the alerts help him stay focused and on top of his work. I tell him the world won’t stop turning if he doesn’t reply to a text or call from a client immediately, but he won’t have it. I used to enjoy sitting at the dining table with him as we worked, but now I’ve retreated to the tiny office we have in the spare room. I can’t concentrate with all the noise. It’s not just work – he keeps his phone on loud in the evenings, too. Our conversations and private time are constantly interrupted by alerts announcing some Instagram updates. Derek’s phone is constantly glued to his hand, and he lights up when it pings. It’s a dopamine thing, I suppose. I think he’s addicted to it. He says the alerts help him stay focused and on top of his work The only other people I know who have their phones on full volume are over-60s who aren’t very good with technology. Derek and I are only in our early 30s. He should know how to use his phone on silent. Related: You be the judge: should my partner take the bin out more often? At night I’ve forced him to put his iPhone on “do not disturb” mode so we can sleep uninterrupted, but even that was a big deal for him. He said: “What if there’s an emergency?” But if it’s midnight, we shouldn’t be disturbed. Derek suffers from phone Fomo (fear of missing out), but he needs to turn the volume down when he’s working in the house. If he won’t, I’ll have to ask him to move to a co-working space. I am not putting up with it any longer.","Phone notifications are supposed to make a sound. That’s how notifications work The sound on my phone is always on. Phones make a sound for a reason – so that we can stay on track of our notifications and messages. I don’t know why Ravinda is so offended by this concept. Having the sound on is not an “older people” thing, like Ravinda always jokes. Lots of people I know think keeping your phone on silent mode is annoying. I don’t have a particularly stressful job, but I do work from home and manage my own digital marketing business. I’m constantly arranging calls and replying to my clients, so of course I want to keep everyone happy. Ravinda’s role isn’t as full-on as mine, so perhaps she doesn’t understand. Yes, my phone volume is turned up to the max, but I like it that way. I don’t think my ringtone is any more annoying than the next person’s, and the sound for my notifications is the default option on the iPhone. Perhaps I do get a bit of a thrill out of feeling busy all the time. I don’t want to miss out on what’s going on during the work day, and in the evening I like to keep up to date with social media posts. I also have sound alerts for my emails and trending news topics that interest me: anything crypto-related, for example. Ravinda’s role isn’t as full-on as mine, so perhaps she doesn’t understand I used to keep the sound on during the night when my phone was charging near my bed, but I’ve stopped that at Ravinda’s request. I suppose it’s better for us both if we can sleep without it going off. Sometimes I do worry that I’ll miss out on a last-minute request from a client or a finance update though. Ravinda said she couldn’t work next to me because of my phone alerts, but that’s not true. We’re both frequently in meetings and on calls, so surely it’s best if we have our own space so we don’t distract one another. It’s not my phone’s fault that we have to work at home. I can try to be more present after work and not be as focused on my notifications when they aren’t super-important. But I will continue to have my phone on full volume. It makes my life easier.",guilty,high
"Sally keeps all her books, even old school textbooks. They’re scattered in piles all over the house Sally and I met at school in 2015, and after four years of dating we got married last year. She’s always been a big reader and while I enjoy a book now and again, I don’t read as much as her. I also get rid of my books once I’ve read them. I don’t think that you need to keep every single book you’ve ever read on the shelf for the rest of your life. Sally’s books take up space across all the shelves, and accumulate in little piles all over the house – on the countertop, around the bed, by the sofa, on the coffee table. It’s annoying as I like a tidy house. We have a massive bookshelf in our bedroom, another in our office and more in the living room. But it’s not enough. Every year Sally will get books for her birthday and Christmas. They add up quickly. I’m fine with Sally keeping books that are meaningful to her I’m fine with Sally keeping books that are meaningful to her, but there are probably only five or 10 books in that category. And of course some books that should never be thrown out – things like dictionaries. Coffee-table books about, say, photography or travel, can stay, as they are decorative. Related: You be the judge: tell us about your domestic disputes But other than that, pretty much every book should live in our house only temporarily. They are replaceable and should be updated regularly to make space for newer titles. When we had a clear-out recently, Sally grumbled about having to throw her books away. But does she really need to keep her GCSE textbooks? We’re in our twenties and don’t need to hang on to those. Sally says she loves having a large collection of books in case she wants to reread them or lend them, but that never really happens. Besides, we are lucky and live close to a great library, and also have access to a university library through our work. There’s also the option of audiobooks. Sally needs to learn to throw or give books away, have regular clear-outs and adopt a one-in-one-out policy when buying books. Besides, a book is easy to source again should she change her mind. It’s time Sally learned to part with books that are gathering dust in our home.","I don’t buy that many books and they live on mounted bookshelves – so what’s the problem? Andy thinks our house is getting too cluttered because I like to keep all the books I read. But it’s not like we keep books piled up on the floor – they have a home on our bookshelves. We recently took a big box of my books to the charity shop, which I found very sad. I didn’t like parting with my books – I had some of them for 15 years. He once said if I authored a book, we could keep it permanently in the house, but that books bought and sold aren’t really of any sentimental value so should be recycled. I think this view is drastic. Who throws away perfectly good books? He thinks I should start listening to audiobooks instead of buying books. But I don’t buy that many books, maybe one a month, if that. And I really love curling up on the sofa with a real book – audiobooks and Kindles just aren’t the same. Keeping our books for generations could be a great investment Most of my books don’t take up any space because they live on mounted bookshelves. So really, what’s the issue? I can see why he thinks we need a clear-out, but I think we should start by throwing away other things. Related: You be the judge: should my husband stop dusting with a dry cloth? Andy likes doing DIY and has a couple of shoeboxes full of wires and old parts that he uses to make things from scratch. But he never bins any of his half-finished electronics projects. I’m not sure why we need to focus on my books. They’re valuable and sentimental, and if we have kids I’d like to pass some of my books on to them instead of buying them toys. Keeping our books for generations could be a great investment. I like being the person with a great collection. I love lending books to people, too. Andy’s parents have given me a book subscription for my birthday, so I don’t think the book-collecting habit is going to get any better. He’s now saying that I should adopt a one-in-one-out policy. But I am going to ignore it. And I definitely won’t be throwing any books out – at least not until the house is absolutely overflowing.",innocent,medium
"Zara shoves towels into drawers and most of her clothes are crumpled. It’s madness I’ve lived with Zara for six years. We met at university and moved in together after graduating. She’s far messier than me. Living together, I’ve noticed she hasn’t learned how to fold clothes and put things away without crumpling them. Zara doesn’t fold anything – she crams. She has done this ever since I’ve known her. Tea towels will be shoved into drawers, completely crumpled. In her room, Zara hangs up a few key items, but if you open her drawers it’s total chaos. Most of her clothes remain eternally crumpled. She refuses to fold pyjamas, vest tops and underwear. She doesn’t even pair up her socks! She says: “What’s the point, my socks are all white so I can just grab any two.” Related: You be the judge: tell us about your domestic disputes I think it’s madness to live in such a disorganised way. I find folding clothes quite therapeutic. I’m not extreme, but I do keep things in order. Tidy room, tidy mind. I also iron my bedsheets and some of our shared items like cushion covers and bath mats. Zara says it’s a waste of time. But I like things to be crispy and creaseless, especially if they are on display. When we went on holiday recently, the baggage allowance was small, so we decided to split one large suitcase. We argued about how to pack before we left. I prefer to use packing cubes – they’re these little fabric pouches that help you organise your items and save you space. I bought enough cubes for both of us, but Zara refused to try them. I watched her roll up towels and bikinis and say that “would do”. On the way back, she had loads of dirty clothes that she chucked in with our remaining clean ones. Using packing cubes would have been more hygienic. Her method also took up more space and was less efficient. I iron my bedsheets and some of our shared items like cushion covers and bath mats I don’t mind if Zara refuses to fold things at home as long as she makes an effort with my stuff or our shared items. The tea towels and bathroom towels need to be folded after washing because they look messy and otherwise remain crinkled for ages. We aren’t at uni any more – I think Zara needs to grow up.","Life is short – why waste time arranging your underwear and ironing the towels? I don’t think my resistance to ironing sheets or folding my clothes makes me an untidy or slovenly person. If anything, it makes me an efficient one. Life is short, so why waste time arranging underwear drawers or ironing things that are meant to be crumpled, like towels? If it’s a work blazer or a good dress, I’d give it a quick iron and then hang it up. But towels and bath mats, which are usually wet and washed frequently, definitely don’t need to be ironed – or even folded. After washing towels I just chuck them in the drawer because we go through them so quickly. There’s no need to fold them. And no one sees them until they are being used, and by that point they’re dirty again. Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights. I don’t iron my bed sheets as they go straight on the bed, or waste time folding elastic things that don’t crease, like gym wear. It’s common sense. Rita makes out that not ironing and folding things makes me a slob, but I don’t like to waste energy. My underwear drawer is chaos to her but to me it’s a symbol of my freedom – I’m free because I don’t spend time ironing and folding things that nobody really sees. Rita tries to make out that not ironing and folding things makes me a slob When we went on holiday, I had the idea to share one large suitcase instead of paying for two medium ones. It helped us save money, and was a great plan until Rita tried to force me to pack my half the way she wanted with these silly cubes. They were impractical. You had to fold the items to put them in the cube. Then arrange the cubes in the case. What’s the point? Related: You be the judge: should my husband spend less time playing video games? Rita got irritated that I just wanted to chuck my stuff in the case. She was like: “Oh, but I’ve bought these for you and it will keep everything neat.” I did appreciate the gesture but I’m sure that my method saved more time. I definitely won’t be folding our shared items in our flat. I like to keep it tidy but I’m not anal. And no one has ever come around and said: “Wow, the place looks great but your bath mat hasn’t been ironed.” Nobody cares. Rita needs to relax and focus on the bigger things in life.",innocent,medium
"Chris only gives the dishes a quick wash, but says my soaking technique is unhygienic Chris, my partner, washes up like a scummy student – he gives everything a quick rinse with a soapy cloth, rather than let the sink fill up and leave the dishes to soak. It’s irritating. I wash up like a normal person: I fill a sink with hot water and washing-up liquid, and scrub the dishes in order of what needs the least attention. Glasses need a quick wipe and then they’re put aside, while the cutlery has a nice little soak at the bottom. You finish with the pans. If at any point the bubbles are not sparkling white, the water is dirty and needs to be refilled. I then move the dishes to the drying rack, without rinsing them off. In my opinion, this is the cleanest, most hygienic way of doing things, because everything has a little bath in the sink. At Guides I got a badge for washing up, so I can’t be that bad Chris says that because I don’t rinse them, my dishes are covered in suds and dirty water. But there’s no need to rinse if things have been scrubbed properly and left to drip-dry. His way also wastes water as the tap is kept continually running. We got together five years ago, and when we met I’d say “Why don’t you fill the sink, let things soak and wash up properly? It’s not hard.” He still won’t listen. It’s come to a head recently as we’re getting our kitchen redone and we disagree over what kind of sink to go for. Chris wants two sinks so you can have space to rinse dishes separately from the rest of the washing up, whereas I’d like an elegant one-bowl sink to do a big soak. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes As a child in the Guides, I got a badge for washing up, so I can’t be that bad at it. I was also a kitchen porter; I know how to wash dishes properly. I try to hold my tongue when I see Chris lightly rinse things under a tap and then claim it’s clean. We’ve spent nights Googling our different styles, trying to find others online who wash up like us. I’ll find examples that prove that I’m right, but then so does Chris. I hate watching water run down the drain: it’s just how I was brought up. Rinsing is pointless – the important thing is to scrub the dirt off in the first place. Chris needs to wash up the traditional way.","Plates need rinsing; they aren’t clean if they’ve been soaking for ages in a sink full of dirty water I have the tap running while I wash up. I scrub the dishes as I go, then rinse them under the tap to get off all the grease and scum, then they go in the draining rack. Penny likes to take dishes out of the dirty water and put them straight on to the rack, which is incorrect. Taking soapy dishes straight out of the sink to dry means you’re later going to eat from a dish covered in dried soap scum and dirty water. You have to rinse. You’re not going to take a spoon and dip it in dirty sink water and stir your coffee with it, are you? That would be crazy. If you’re not bothered about rinsing your plates and dishes off, why wash them at all? Penny says my way of washing up is a crime against the environment because I’m being wasteful by letting the tap run. I suppose that’s true, but hygiene is my main concern, whereas waste is hers. I tell Penny: “Plates just aren’t clean if they’ve been soaking in dirty water for ages and not rinsed off.” And also, most of the time you’ve just eaten off them, so they don’t need soaking anyway. She doesn’t listen. But if you’re not bothered about rinsing your plates and dishes off, why wash them at all? Why not just carry on eating from them again and again? Penny’s method takes longer and doesn’t achieve as good a result. I usually do a bit more of the washing up, but when it’s Penny’s turn I watch her take dishes out of the murky water and place them straight on the rack. Occasionally I’ll say, sarcastically: “I can’t wait to eat breakfast off that grimy plate tomorrow.” Usually I don’t say anything, though. I value my life too much. I’ve also been a kitchen porter in a curry house – and rinsing was everything there. I’ve no problem with soaking things in hot water, but it’s what you do afterwards that worries me. Penny needs to rinse them off and finish the cleaning properly. We’ve reached an impasse about the sink in our new kitchen. Our current sink has a large main bowl and a small side sink for rinsing. I think we should get another two-bowl sink so we have somewhere to rinse the dishes. Whichever one we choose, though, I won’t be filling it with dirty, soapy water.",innocent,high
"He spends all his evenings in the corner of our dining room, immersed in a fantasy world My husband Jim is obsessed with video games. When I get home from work after him, I know that I’ll find him on the desktop in the corner of our dining room immersed in a fantasy world. When it’s dinner time, it’s a struggle to get him off and to sit at the table with me and our son. He says, “OK, I’ll pause it after this battle.” It’s a bit disruptive to our evening. Sometimes Jim comes to bed really late after playing games – one time he didn’t come upstairs until 2am. I’d like there to be a bit more routine after school, or time for us to enjoy more leisure time as a family Jim plays games with dragons, tanks, battles and soldiers. They’re all very noisy. Sometimes if I’m washing up after dinner and Jim is still playing, I’ll ask him to turn it down. He reluctantly obliges, but I know he prefers to play them at full blast. Sometimes he puts up a bit of resistance and says that I’m “ruining the experience” for him. He won’t get headphones. Although Jim and I both do our share of the housework, there are times I have to say, “Can you help me with this?” He’ll say, “One minute,” but that minute never comes. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes Jim works hard in a government job. When he comes home from work he wants to switch off. He’s a very hands-on father, but our son, who is seven, is starting to copy Jim and likes sitting alongside him while he plays. Boys will be boys, I suppose. But I’d like there to be a bit more time for us to enjoy more leisure time as a family. After dinner and homework, they play games together for hours. I usually go into the next room and watch television. They stay in the same spot all evening. Perhaps I’m a bit jealous. I have absolutely no interest in computer games, but sometimes I’d like the boys to come into the sitting room and for us all to chat together while watching a film. Jim should try and ration the computer games on weekdays at least. Dinner together is nice but we need more time without the video games in the background. I don’t want Jim to set a bad example for our son, and for him not to develop any other hobbies.","After work I need to switch off, but I only play after I’ve made dinner and helped our son with homework I have to admit, I do love playing my video games. They require zero concentration, are lots of fun and I don’t have to communicate with anyone. After a day of work, I need to switch off. When I watch a film with Marlene, she wants to talk every two seconds about what’s happening, or who the main character is. When she watches her soaps there’s also a lot of commentary too – that’s why I don’t really enjoy it. Playing games is a solitary affair, and I like that. I’d be more than happy to get her involved. She hates it, though. She says it’s “a man thing” Marlene has her way of switching off and I have mine. What’s the issue? And our son likes to get involved with my games now, too. I think Marlene envies the fact that we are both really into gaming. I enjoy spending time with him while we play. Marlene could always ask me to teach her how to play, too, then we could do it together. I’d be more than happy to get her involved. She hates it, though. She says it’s “a man thing”. During the week, I always make sure I’ve done our son’s homework with him before we play. I also cook dinner most nights. Marlene may complain, but everything that needs to be done for the family is done first, and the gaming comes second. If Marlene needs a hand with something, I’m always available . Sometimes she asks me to turn the volume down, if the music or the fighting sounds are annoying her, and I always do. Headphones aren’t really something I find comfortable wearing. And anyway, if I did, Marlene would probably get more annoyed as I’d be shutting her out completely. Related: You be the judge: should my boyfriend stop watching TV before bed? It’s rare that I keep Marlene awake with my gaming. The one time I went to bed at 2am I simply got carried away. I apologised the next morning, and it hasn’t happened since.

I think we have a good balance in our house. I don’t think reducing my time on the computer is necessary.",guilty,medium
"Drew can’t take the tension in TV dramas and has to leave the room. It’s infuriating Drew, my husband, won’t binge-watch any TV dramas with me. He says it’s too intense, especially when we’re relaxing at home in the evening after work. But he’s fine with indulging in comedies or something light. It’s annoying, because modern dramas are made for bingeing, but Drew can’t handle it. When things are really exciting or tense, he will leave the room, or ask to stop the episode completely. It’s infuriating. We abandoned Ozark because Drew would say, “I can’t cope with this tonight.” Now I’ve forgotten what’s happened and who’s killed who. We’re now watching half an episode of Succession , twice a week. I am completely into it and want to speed up, but Drew says there are too many awkward and painful scenes to watch an episode in its entirety. He says he wants to finish the series, but we’ve lost momentum and I’m getting bored. Drew says watching people’s families fall apart on TV isn’t enjoyable. I have to remind him he’s not living in the show Drew says watching other families fall apart on TV isn’t an enjoyable way to relax. I have to remind him he’s not actually living in the show. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes I’m a therapist, so perhaps I’m used to conflict. I also grew up in a family where we’d have a massive row, then laugh about it a few hours later. Drew’s family are the opposite. He’s a surgeon, so completely fine with blood, guts and action on screen, but the minute he sees a little bit of interpersonal conflict, he wants to switch off. His attention span is fine with other things, though. He’s happy to play a game for an hour and a half, but not to watch TV with me. I don’t need to binge four hours of TV in one go, but I’d like Drew to be more open to watching one or even two episodes of drama a night. We’re on this journey together, and lose track of the story when we stop. Watching a drama is a bit like reading a book: you need to read a chapter or two a night, especially when it’s a bit complicated. Watching half an episode of a show is pointless and unsatisfying, as each episode is designed to be enjoyed in full. Drew needs to stop moving at a snail’s pace.","I don’t like to watch shows where families are falling apart. I get too invested I’m not a monster; I can binge-watch sometimes, but usually only light comedy shows like Schitt’s Creek , where the stakes aren’t so high. When there’s too much conflict, I’m like, “Oh, that’s enough now.” Claire wants to watch a couple of hours of TV drama each night, but that’s too much for me. I don’t like to watch shows where families fall apart or people’s lives implode. Claire and I have two kids and both work hard. I want our free time together to be relaxing. Claire says: “It’s entertainment; you’re not directly involved.” I realise that, but I do get invested. It’s especially hard when I can relate to the protagonist because it’s another man who looks like me. It’s easier for me to watch half an episode, because most shows resolve the conflict from the previous episode at the start, before introducing a new conflict and ramping up the tension towards a cliff-hanger. If you stop in the middle of one, you avoid the worst of the suspense until you feel like finishing it, usually later in the week. I can deal with conflict, but I don’t especially like it. A family conflict in my household as a kid was a nuclear event Claire gets annoyed that I can focus on a computer game and not a show, but a game involves zero stress. A family drama is the opposite. In other areas of my life, I can deal with conflict, but I don’t especially like it. When I was a child, a family conflict in our household was a nuclear event – something to be avoided at all costs. When it did happen, there’d would be three days of fallout. Now I’m a surgeon. I always wanted a job where I could just focus on practical tasks. We’re watching Succession at the moment, but I find it stressful. During the big family argument scenes I get up and pace around, or leave the room. I know it annoys Claire, but I can’t help it. Every episode builds to some kind of family showdown. It’s like listening to your neighbours argue through the wall. I also think dramas are too long these days. As a student I could binge a whole box set, but now the thought of 30 hours of TV is intimidating. I can’t see myself ever truly binge-watching – unless it’s something fluffy and light.",guilty,high
"My girlfriend cranks the heating up year-round. It’s expensive, unnecessary and bad for the planet My girlfriend Hannah and I have lived together since September last year. Our home is a modern two-bedroom flat, so it retains its heat quite well and is very energy efficient. But we constantly disagree over what temperature to keep our home. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes I prefer a cooler temperature in the house – I like it to be around 20C in the winter, but Hannah prefers it a few degrees higher. But if you’re too cold, it’s better to wear a jumper around the house rather than immediately reaching for the thermostat. I like to be able to move around the house without feeling too hot. There’s also the environmental aspect to consider. We all know by now that overheating our homes isn’t good for the planet. Before we moved in together, Hannah lived in old student houses that were really cold so I think she craved a cosy home. She also grew up in the Middle East so she’s not used to British winters. When we got our own place, I wanted to set boundaries around the heating by ensuring that we keep it at an agreed temperature. But, on a few occasions, I’ve come home from work and found the flat roasting. Hannah gets home before me and the first thing she does is crank up the temperature. I’ve come back and seen it at 26C. I’m like: “What’s all this then?” Hannah will claim she’s only had it at that level for a short amount of time. I wanted to keep the flat at an agreed temperature, but I’ve come home and seen the thermostat at 26C My parents were very strict about heating. My dad had a silly rule: “No heating until November.” And even then it was set low, to 18C. We never had it on in summer. I’ve always lived in a cold house. Now it is getting warmer, but we’re still keeping the flat at 22C – that’s a compromise between 20C (too cold for Hannah) and 24C (too hot for me). Hannah wants me to consider turning up the heating in summer if she’s chilly. But in my opinion it’s usually unnecessary to have it on unless it’s unusually cold. Also, energy bills are increasing rapidly. I don’t want a shock bill next winter, because I don’t want to financially compromise in other areas of our life.","Women feel the cold more, and I want my home to be cosy. Wearing layers indoors is just annoying I’m used to being warm. I was raised in the Middle East and I moved to England when I was 10 and found it hard to adjust to the climate. My family home was always really warm. It’s nice to come home to a cosy house when you have to deal with the cold at work (I’m a scientist in a lab) and outside. I usually keep the flat at 22C, but I occasionally turn it up if I’m a bit cold. I don’t think that you should wear more layers at home, it’s annoying and uncomfortable having loads of clothes on. At home you should feel free. It’s not more environmentally friendly because wearing more clothes means you have to wash them more regularly. It’s not an environmental thing because wearing more clothes means you have to wash them more regularly This is also a gender thing; women are naturally colder and office temperatures are often tailored to men. In my lab, I wear jumpers and a lab coat when I’m working. Steven acknowledges that he grew up in a cold house and that it wasn’t good. I think he should be more flexible about heating in our house. He shouldn’t get so hung up on the number of the thermostat – he has this thing that if we make the house warmer than 22C he can’t be comfortable. I think it’s in his head a little bit. I do sometimes turn the heating up to 26C in winter before Steven comes back from work. If I get caught I say: “It was just on for a bit and I’m going to turn it down again when I warm up.” Having the heating on low overnight bothers me less because the duvet keeps me warm. I do want the heating on in the summer. Summer weather in the UK is inconsistent so I can feel cold at times. Ideally, I’d turn the heating on most nights before bed, or when temperature drops below 15C – which still happens a lot in warmer months here. Having the heating on all year around is optimum for me. If one person is really warm or cold, we should both be open to adjusting the temperature accordingly. It depends who feels most strongly about it at the time. I appreciate that our gas bills will be expensive with the price rising, but it’s a necessity. I’d rather compromise in other areas to keep the heating on.",guilty,high
"We’ve been married for 63 years and are stuck in a food rut. It’s time to try something new I have been cooking for my husband, Lyndon, for most of my adult life, but after 63 years of marriage, I want to spice our meals up. He’s a very simple eater – he likes cottage pies, roasts with meat and two veg – but I’m getting bored of all that. I’m facing a bit of resistance, though. I’ve bought ingredients like Thai mixed spices, but I rarely use them as Lyndon kicks up a fuss. Curry does not pass his lips – he really dislikes it. He also hates pasta. Related: You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes I try to encourage him to eat foods from around the world, but he just says: “I’m not eating that rubbish.” It’s very narrow-minded. He’s also not fond of quiches or lasagne. He likes me to make a lot of roasts with potatoes, beetroot, cabbage and tomatoes from our garden. He says: “English food is the best.” But I always say: “There’s more out there.” Recently I’ve been sneaking a bit of cayenne pepper into the mince when I make a shepherd’s pie. Lyndon loves it. He will say, “That was tasty,” which I find amusing. I’m 83 now and over the years I’ve learned various ways to be sneaky in our marriage. I will try something new when we eat out, but Lyndon will always stick to what he knows. One time in a restaurant, he sent back a turkey steak because it was too spicy. He made a scene, which I found embarrassing. Recently I’ve been sneaking cayenne pepper in the mince when I make a shepherd’s pie We both eat differently now compared to when we met in 1955. I’ve become more adventurous, but Lyndon has gone the opposite way. We were just children when the second world war ended, but rationing went on for years. Nobody knew what pizza was. Over the years there has been a food revolution with interesting cuisines available everywhere, which I love. I’ve got Lyndon into frozen pizzas and now he thinks they are very tasty – but he doesn’t like them too often. When I ask him what he likes for dinner, he says: “Cook whatever is easiest.” But if I serve up a lasagne, there’s a chance he will get into a huff. It’s not worth the argument. Lyndon needs to broaden his palate.","I’m 87 and like traditional British dishes . I don’t enjoy spicy food, so what’s the point in changing now? Traditional British food is my favourite cuisine. I don’t need my dishes to be of a ridiculously high standard but I like what I like. I’m 87, so really, at my age, what’s the point in changing? I’m not one for curry. I had it a couple of times and I can’t deal with the spice, even when it’s mild. I like my food seasoned but not too much. I don’t want things to be completely bland but I don’t like too many spices or herbs. If we are eating out and I have to foot the bill for something I didn’t enjoy, I’ll be very annoyed. The time I sent back the spicy turkey steak at a restaurant was justified – it was inedible, you couldn’t taste the meat. I know Alice was embarrassed but that’s just how I am. I don’t agree with Alice that I’m a fussy or boring eater. Once we went away to Scotland and ended up at a Thai restaurant, where the food was excellent. I usually stick to what I know, but on that occasion, I felt more adventurous. That doesn’t happen very often, though. Alice enjoys eating different cuisines. That’s fine; we can each do what we like outside the home. Inside it, I think we should stick to what we’ve always done. Every day we have a pudding and I always say to Alice, “Make whatever is easiest”: apple pies, rice pudding, crumbles. I’m not fussy. We’ve been lucky with our health so far and I put that down to eating a varied but traditional British diet. Why fix what’s not broken? We’ve been lucky with our health and I put that down to a varied but traditional British diet I don’t think I’m difficult to cater for. I seldom quibble. If Alice serves a quiche or pasta, I might complain because I find those dishes boring and insubstantial. I prefer meat and two veg as it’s more interesting and balanced. Related: You be the judge: should my housemate stop letting dirty dishes pile up? There are times when Alice doesn’t come up to scratch with her cooking, but I won’t say anything. We’ve been married so long there’s no point. And I don’t mind the occasional lasagne or pizza these days. After 63 years, you’re so set in your ways. I won’t be changing my palate. I’m quite happy with the rut we’ve found ourselves in.",guilty,high
"Doing your washing up straight away is just common sense – and much more hygienic We don’t have a dishwasher in our flat, so the washing up became an issue pretty quickly. Jakiyah and I have lived together for two years – we met through mutual friends at university. I prefer the washing up to be done straight away, but Jakiyah is a “worry about it later” type of person. If she’s in a rush in the morning, she will leave a bowl with bits of porridge in it soaking in the sink all day, sometimes for several days. After a big dinner, Jakiyah rarely washes up straight away. There have also been times when she’s chopped raw meat and not cleaned the knives and boards immediately after. If you leave dirty dishes in the sink, they can get very grim very quickly and become a breeding ground for germs. Jakiyah thinks I’m a clean freak, but to me washing up straight away is just common sense. If you leave dishes soaking for days, then have to stick your hand in the sink to clean them or pull the plug, you are going to get germs on your hands. My cooking had to wait while she cleaned everything. It was very inconsiderate Anita One Friday, I was working from home and Jakiyah was heading to the gym. She made an elaborate breakfast and then left all the pans in the sink. Then she came back with a friend that night and cooked a curry, and left those pans in there, too. On Saturday she must have cooked something else as by Sunday there was a mountain of unwashed dishes in the sink. I said, “This is gross, why did you let it build up?” She told me it wasn’t a big deal, but I was annoyed. My cooking had to wait while she cleaned everything. It was very inconsiderate. We do get along well, but with housework I am tidier. I try to design a schedule. We split the chores. I can try and be a bit more relaxed with other chores, but not with the washing up. I work from home so I notice when things aren’t done. We are both busy women, but it would be nice if I didn’t have to ask Jakiyah not to let dirty dishes pile up. We are in our mid-20s, we aren’t students any more.","I do most of the cooking, so it’s not unfair that I sometimes leave the dishes if I’m in a rush There are two types of people in this world: those who stress over menial chores, and those who don’t. I fall into the latter category. If I’m in a rush I will leave out my dishes for a day or two and I don’t see anything wrong with that. There are simply not enough hours in the day to tidy as you go when cooking. I don’t buy this idea that one bowl is a breeding ground for germs that could make you sick – that’s very over the top. If I’m chopping raw meat I will wash up the chopping board immediately. Other than that, I think it’s fine to leave things. Anita will bring up the fact that I’ve left one mug, a spoon and a bowl in the sink. It’s a bit ridiculous Jakiyah In the mornings I’m in a rush to get out the door, so it makes sense to soak my bowl after I’ve had my porridge. It’s also easier to clean after a few hours’ soaking. On that weekend when the dishes piled up, I was out and about. The washing up was the last thing on my mind. I did it on Sunday and Anita had plenty of time to use the kitchen after me. It wasn’t a big deal. I usually do most of the cooking in the flat, so it’s only fair that Anita does a little more of the washing up. She enjoys the dishes I make because they are elaborate. Using all the pots, pans and utensils to make a meal is a sign of a good chef. If I was cooking basic food, she wouldn’t like that either. I think a lot of it is down to the fact that she works from home, whereas I go to an office. She spends most of her day inside and so naturally she notices the little things when I’m not there. I try to stick to her cleaning schedule, but when it comes to the washing up, she needs to relax. Anita and I generally get on well, but it’s irritating when we argue over this very small issue. I have tried to be better and wash up immediately, but I can’t always manage it. And Anita will bring up the fact that I’ve left one mug, a spoon and a bowl in the sink if it’s been there for more than a day. It’s a bit ridiculous. There’s more to life than washing up.",guilty,high
"The TV feels like the third person in the room. Brendan will even initiate sex while a film is playing If you have problems with sleep, you need good sleep hygiene: go to bed at the same time every night, don’t work in the bed, and no screen time. But my boyfriend, Brendan, says he can’t fall asleep unless the TV is on. He likes to watch Scorsese and Tarantino films before bed. There’s loads of noise, violence and action coming from our TV – a large flatscreen that gives off loads of light and keeps me awake. It’s been like this since I moved in with him six months ago. I knew he had problems with sleep before; when he stayed at mine he often needed to listen to a podcast before bed (I didn’t have a TV in the bedroom). But since I’ve moved into his place, I’ve realised how bad his sleep habits are. I complained about it, but Brendan just suggested I should use an eye mask to block the light out. I tried that but the noise still kept me awake, even when he turned it down low, so he started using earphones. It feels like he’s making half an effort. The bed should be a place to cuddle and connect I then tried wearing my mask while he watched TV with his AirPods in, but it felt ridiculous. I read a book instead, but Brendan didn’t want me to have the light on. Now I read my Kindle with the backlight on until he falls asleep. I have to wait for him to doze off, then I get out of bed, turn the TV off and keep reading until I get drowsy. If I wasn’t there, Brendan would just leave the TV on all night. The bedroom is a sacred space. When you go to sleep with a partner, you expect to get close and intimate, but a television ruins that. I also like the element of play and mystery at night, wondering if we will kiss when we get into bed. But suddenly I’m in a relationship where the TV is always on and it feels like there is a third person in the room. It kills the mood. Sometimes Brendan will initiate sex while a film is playing, which I find distracting and quite rude. It feels like he’s making half an effort. The bed should be a place to cuddle and connect. Brendan needs to see a sleep specialist because his habits are affecting our relationship and my sleep.","Charlotte reads on her Kindle and I drift off the way I like – I don’t see the issue I’ve always needed a bit of background noise to help me drift off to sleep, and Charlotte has always known this. When I used to stay over at hers, I would put my AirPods in and listen to something before bed. She was fine with that. But now she’s moved into my place, where I like to watch television in bed before sleeping. I know people say exposure to artificial light before sleep is bad for you, but there’s something comforting about having a film on in the background. I find it really soothing and it helps me switch off. I disagree with the idea that we aren’t as intimate with a TV in the room. It doesn’t affect our sex life in any way I suggested that Charlotte use an eye mask, and she was more than happy to give it a go. It seemed to work well for a little while – I would turn the TV volume down really low, and she wouldn’t be affected by the light as her eyes were covered. But then she said it wasn’t good enough, so I offered to listen to the TV with my headphones. Now she reads on her Kindle while I watch TV on my AirPods – I also turn the brightness down on the TV. I get to drift off the way I like. I’m not really sure what the issue is. Charlotte says she doesn’t like the idea of us doing different things in bed, but the reality is we can’t always be in sync. We both work from home so we do spend a lot of time together. We make sure we have date nights. A couple of times we did get intimate with the TV on and it seemed fine. But later Charlotte told me she found it distracting. I’ve taken that onboard, but she needs to be more upfront with her feelings at the time. I disagree that we aren’t as intimate because there’s a TV in the bedroom – it doesn’t affect our sex life in any way. We could both make more of an effort to go to bed earlier. Sometimes we stay up until 1am for no real reason, though Charlotte is more of a night owl than me. I’m up for working on a better sleep schedule, both for my own health and Charlotte’s. But if I still can’t sleep, the television will just have to go back on and Charlotte can use her eye mask.",guilty,high
"Peter loves his bikes; we now have a garage, but he still keeps one in the house When I first met my husband Peter, he lived in a flat and kept a large, powerful motorbike, a Kawasaki Z1, in the hall. Trying to squeeze past it with shopping was a nightmare. Then there was a smaller vintage bike, called a Gilera, in the living room and another huge bike, a Ducati, in the bedroom. I was surrounded by them. We recently bought a house together with a beautiful garage and I thought: great, the bikes will be happy and comfortable there. But then a storm approached. Peter began to get agitated and worried that a branch would crash through the roof and damage the bikes. Before I knew it, the Gilera had snuck into the house again. He said it would only be there for a few days. But after the storm passed it was still there and ended up staying for weeks. A few months later, we got a puppy. It started biting everything – that’s when Peter finally returned the Gilera to the garage. I think the only reason he did it was to protect it from the puppy, not because I wanted it gone. After it disappeared I felt joy. I thought: I’m not going to trip over it or find bits of it in my kitchen. I often say Peter loves his Gilera more than he loves me. He’s had it since he was 16. Peter loves to stick bits of his motorbike into the dishwasher, which I find alarming The two bigger bikes stay in the garage, but once the puppy stops biting, Peter wants to bring the Gilera back into the house. But it creates a mess. I’ve had a lot of stains on our carpets and flooring. One time, Peter hung lights around one of the bikes to make it look like a nice art display, but something happened and he burned a hole in the carpet. We’ve also bought a posh dishwasher – and Peter loves to stick bits of his motorbike into it, which I find alarming. I’m not against Peter having his bikes – we’ve taken several trips with me on the back, and I go to his vintage motorbike shows. But bikes in the house are a hazard. The Gilera really needs to stay in the garage unless there’s a real emergency. The bigger bikes stay out entirely.

It’s also widely accepted that they work better when you store them in dry, warm places so I really feel they should be allowed in the house. After we bought this house, we learned that a branch from the walnut tree above our garage had once blown off during a gale and crashed through the roof. I really didn’t want that to happen during the storm when the Gilera was in there, so I moved it inside. Sandy wasn’t pleased. She said: “What the heck is this doing in my house?” The Gilera is the only bike I really want inside. It was built in 1973 and it’s a gorgeous little thing. With the Z1, I do admit that it was difficult to walk past in my old place. I remember one time my bag got caught on a hook and split and the shopping went everywhere. But when you’re careful it’s usually not a problem. I’ve also never put any bike parts in the dishwasher that are greasy or oily. There’s actually a lot more grease from a tray you cook chicken on. My wife feels that houses are for ‘nice’ things – but in my eyes, motorbikes have the same status as a work of art Sandy’s extensive paperweight collection is displayed in our home – it’s only fair that I’m allowed to bring in a precious little motorcycle. People have preconceived ideas of what should be in houses, and they can be unfair. My wife feels that houses are for “nice” things. Her friends agree with her and gang up on me. But in my eyes, motorbikes have the same status as a work of art. The time I tried to hang lights around the bike was a terrible accident.

It’s not true that I love bikes more than I love Sandy.

I think to compromise I can ask Sandy before I need to move a bike inside the house next time, but I can’t promise there won’t be a next time.",guilty,medium
"Ray has become a bit intolerant since I’ve gone vegetarian Ray is generally a good person to live with, but since I’ve gone vegetarian I think he’s become a bit intolerant. I was never a big meat-eater before I met my girlfriend; I was always trying to up my protein intake with unhealthy shakes and supplements. My girlfriend, who is vegan, taught me that I don’t need all that. Ray could take a leaf out of my book, as cutting animal products out of my diet has made me feel amazing. Surely he should want that, too. Since then, I’ve bought new kitchenware as I don’t want Ray’s cooking to contaminate our food. I have asked him a few times to stop using my pots and pans but he still does it – I think he gets a slight kick out of seeing me panic. Once, when I smelled pork on my pan, I told him he was selfish and that I don’t want meat in my veggie meals. He did apologise and said he got them mixed up, but he also told me to calm down in a silly voice, as if it were a joke. He needs to be more considerate. Ray points out that while I have become a vegetarian, I still smoke. He thinks it means I’m a hypocrite, but that’s a false equivalence. It’s a way to silence me when I start telling him about the problems with eating meat. I believe it’s a good idea to be more conscientious with regard to the impact we are leaving on the planet. Ray says he can’t live how he wants in his own home, but that’s not true Paolo My girlfriend doesn’t come around that much, but when she does we try to cook at different times to Ray so we don’t have to smell or touch meat. She doesn’t want to use utensils covered in animal products either. We’ve tried to devise a schedule, and I always tell Ray in advance when she’s coming, but he gets sulky and complains. He says, “I can’t live how I want to in my own home,” but that’s not true. Ray needs to adapt to my lifestyle changes as I would do the same for him. He needs to realise we aren’t the same selfish twentysomethings we were when we met. I want to be healthier, live longer, and reduce my carbon footprint. If Ray did the same, it would benefit him and everyone else, too.","Paolo once told me I was killing myself because I’d made a tuna sandwich I moved into this flat with Paolo a couple of years ago. Paolo was a big meat-eater, which worked, as I am too. We ordered pepperoni pizzas for our hangovers and occasionally cooked the odd fry-up or curry in the week. But Paolo recently went vegetarian and now he wants to control how I cook meat in our kitchen, which is not fair. It all started when he began dating his new girlfriend. She sends him Netflix documentaries about vegan athletes and the ills of the meat and fish industries. After their first month of dating, Paolo was converted. He threw out all the bacon and burgers in our house, including some of mine. Paolo bought himself a separate fridge and lectures me on the dangers of eating animal products. I compromise by letting them cook alone, but it’s annoying, sneaking a Nando’s up to my room Ray Once he told me I was “killing myself” when I made a tuna sandwich. That was a bit intense. I care about my health, but I’m not going to change my diet based on his views. He’s too forceful with his opinions. Paolo tries to get me to eat chickpea burgers, salad and stuffed peppers as it’s “better” for my health. His girlfriend visits often and they cook vegan meals together. It means I can’t be in the kitchen at the same time as them. They say the smell and sight of meat makes them sick. I do compromise by letting them cook alone, but it’s annoying having to sneak a Nando’s up to my room. When Paolo first went vegetarian, cooking in our flat was fine; we just did everything separately. Then he bought new pans as he didn’t want the “meat juice” contaminating his food. One time he said I was poisoning him. However, he still smokes. Paolo needs to relax and mind his own business if he wants me to stay in this house. He can’t expect me to change my lifestyle overnight to suit him. We don’t socialise together as much now, because he’s always with his girlfriend and prefers vegan beer and bland meals to the stuff we used to like. Paolo could also stop banning me from the shared spaces when we both need to cook, and remember that he once loved a good steak.",innocent,high
"I’m not against my sister going out and having fun, but she’s also got to respect my boundaries Before Mariana, my older sister, moved in last summer, I had my own space and routine in this flat. I was nervous because she’s such an extrovert and I knew our lifestyles were different. Mariana loves going out, meeting new people and having parties, whereas I’m really not into any of that. We established rules right away, one of which was that we couldn’t have strangers here. I knew that when my sister lived at university she had parties that got out of control, so I said: “Only friends and friends of friends, no strangers.” She didn’t like it, and said whatever she does in her room should be her business, but I argued that it’s a shared space and I want to feel safe. Mariana is a lot more free than me, sexually and socially, but I told her she needed to compromise and eventually she agreed. Mariana loves going out, meeting new people and having parties, whereas I’m really not used into any of that The first night I left her alone, Mariana had a huge party with a band she met at a club. There were loads of people in our flat when I got back, and the floor was sticky. The morning after, Mariana was apologetic, saying things just got out of hand; she seemed so sorry I let it go. But then about two months later she brought a random guy back for the night. She had called at 2am that night to warn me and told me he was a friend of a friend who had lost his keys. She said he’d be stranded if we didn’t let him crash so I’d agreed. But when I started chatting to them, it quickly became clear the story didn’t add up. I was stewing all the next morning; then Mariana confessed she’d made up the story because she’d wanted him to stay over. We got into a huge fight. Mariana thought I’d overreacted but she broke my trust over a random guy, so what did she expect? Since then, Mariana hasn’t brought anyone back (that I know of). I’m not against her dating casually, but she needs to respect my boundaries. I also think it’s better if she gets to know someone before bringing them home. This rule isn’t about controlling her; it’s about protecting her and our shared space – why can’t she see that?

She’s younger than me, still at university, and has less experience with relationships. But I’m in my mid-20s, and the rule makes a big difference to my life. Before living with Mafalda, I lived with a friend and we did what we wanted. I’m sexually comfortable and used to bringing people to my space. After my sister and I agreed on the rule, I was still really defensive. I said it was my room and my space. When I had the party that first time, Mafalda wasn’t even there for most of the night. There wasn’t much to apologise for as I cleaned up the mess. I had planned on inviting just a few people but loads turned up at the door. I knew most of them though. Mafalda once said that I shouldn’t be having casual sex, which annoyed me – it’s not her business We’ve had quite a few fights about my love life. Mafalda said if I had been dating someone for a while, she would be OK with it, but if it was the first or second date, she wouldn’t want them around. She would feel uncomfortable. I was offended that she doesn’t trust my judgment. Does she think I go for terrible, dangerous guys? She once said I shouldn’t be having casual sex, which annoyed me – it’s not her business. I tried to explain that I would never bring someone back who would put me in a dangerous situation, much less her. That one time I brought a guy back and lied to her was stupid. Mafalda bought into it for a while but we were clearly drunk and lying. Afterwards, she and I had a huge fight and she didn’t talk to me for days. I tried to apologise but she got really angry. Mafalda kept reiterating that I had no consideration for her wellbeing. She blew it out of proportion, especially when I’m the one cleaning the house and cooking dinners – she forgot about all that. After a few days we had a long conversation. Now, ideally, if I want to bring a guy home I’ll prepare Mafalda and make sure she’s heard of him before so it’s not a surprise. But there may be times when this doesn’t work or she doesn’t approve, and I can’t stop living my life to suit her.",guilty,medium
"With the Christmas decorations, mum rules with a rod of iron – and takes away all the fun For as long as I can remember we’ve called my mum “Mrs Claus”, because she really gets into the spirit of Christmas. Her mother was the same – it’s traditional. But the decorating process is never without tension. One year, when arranging tinsel, I accidentally smashed a vintage glass bauble that mum had inherited from her family. She fell to her knees and let out this loud, low wail. She shouted “You’re careless!” at me and didn’t talk to me for two days. Over the years we’ve lost a wise man , a baby Jesus and the Virgin Mary. All of them smashed to smithereens. Each time I tried to hide it from mum for as long as possible. When she finds out, all hell breaks loose. We’re told that we don’t look after things, that we’re selfish. But accidents happen. Over the years, we’ve lost a wise man, a baby Jesus and the Virgin Mary. When she finds out, all hell breaks loose Decorating our house is a huge process – it begins with going into the cellar, where there are boxes and boxes of ornaments – and takes two days. Mum wants the tree up on 1 December and not taken down until the end of January. I think it should come down straight after 1 January, but my opinion doesn’t matter. Everything has to be done to mum’s taste. If I’m not heavily involved she will accuse me of being uninterested, but when I do take charge of something – say, the lights – she will control it. I’ll spend ages arranging them only for her to take one look and say, “I don’t like it.” It’s exhausting. None of us kids lives at home any more, but when we’re back for Christmas we are expected to step up. I’m the eldest of three, so it falls on me to liaise with my siblings and find time when we’re all free to decorate the house. My mum dictates the whole process from start to finish. If I don’t create a schedule to suit her, it’s, “Oh you never help. You’re so ungrateful.” It’s not that; it’s just hard to get everyone together. This year, I want mum to relax. It’s nice to go all out with the house, but it’s better to take it easy. The process puts too much pressure on us all. Christmas is about family time, not flashing lights and figurines.","My children should be grateful I make the effort to decorate the house, and respect my feelings Every Christmas, I move the boxes from the cellar and put the decorations up. After my hard work, Ciara will pop up and say: “Oh it’s lovely. It all looks so Christmassy. Can I help?” But most of the time it’s already done. For Ciara, the idea of decorating is much more exciting than the reality. She wants to come and place the last bauble on the tree, but even then she will probably break it. A lot of mothers are territorial over the tree. When Ciara was small, she’d bring back decorations she’d made at school. I’d say, “Yes, it’s lovely darling,” then hide it around the back. Now my kids are older, I still like decorating the tree as a family, but when their backs are turned or they’ve gone to bed, I move things about. I rearrange it to my taste. I like things to be symmetrical. I like things to be symmetrical. A bauble in the wrong place can cause a breakdown of diplomatic relations. Nobody wants that When Ciara smashed a bauble that was precious to me, she was like, “Oh, well.” But it had been in the family for years. I don’t think I reacted too badly – she’s exaggerating. But Ciara doesn’t realise that decorations have sentimental value. The nativity crib gets pride of place in our home: we put it in the hallway. I set out the figures to look just right but Ciara always rearranges it. Things have gone missing over the years: the ox and the kings have mysteriously vanished. That stresses me out because I put a lot of effort into making it look good. When it’s time to take down the decorations, everyone is suddenly busy. While Ciara has benefited from my arrangements all Christmas, she quickly disappears when it’s time to remove them. I have an orderly process of packing them away so that next year it’s easy to unbox. But Ciara just wants to throw it all in the cellar. I put a lot of effort into making the house look nice. It’s something my mother always did and it’s been passed down. I want Ciara and her siblings to carry on the tradition but also to ensure that they make themselves free when I ask, and to take more care when handling decorations. Ciara is lucky I still put so much effort into the house each Christmas – many families don’t bother.",guilty,high
"Jay hates fish because of a distressing childhood experience, but it means I can’t have it either I can’t cook fish for me and my boyfriend, Jay, in our shared flat, and it’s getting annoying. I do most of the cooking and I really love seafood. When we were in lockdown I was bored with the usual meat dishes and craved a bit of salmon, but Jay insisted that we didn’t buy any. It’s a big compromise as I’m Portuguese and have grown up on wholesome, healthy fish all my life. Lockdown brought home how much I’ve missed the cooking of my childhood. Jay needs to come round because it’s affecting our mealtimes together. All our joint meals are fish-free so if I want seafood, I cook it when he’s away. One time Jay was out for a work meal and I thought, great, I’ve got free rein, and fried up some mackerel in a pan. Jay came back early and completely overreacted, saying “whoa, that stinks.” He kept washing the pan over and over and wouldn’t use it for a week as he thought the fish smell lingered. I say the crabmeat was long ago and he could try a prawn. He says I’m making him eat something that makes him feel sick We can’t go out to seafood restaurants either. And when we do eat out, Jay goes crazy if I order fish. In fact, he hates it so much that if I’ve got fish on my plate I’m not allowed to use my fork to try some of his food. He’s so fearful of the flavour, even though I ensure there’s never any fish on the fork. It’s irrational and ridiculous. We usually split dishes and bills 50/50, but if I’ve ordered a fish dish, he will tell me I have to pay more because he didn’t get to try my order. Jay says he hates fish because when he was six, his dad gave him pasta mixed with a can of crabmeat that was three years past the sell-by date. It was disgusting. Since then he’s not been able to stomach seafood of any kind. Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights. I would like him to try fish again: he’s an adult now and surely our tastebuds change over time. I tell him the crabmeat episode was a long time ago and that he could try a prawn, but he tells me I am forcing him to eat something that makes him feel sick. It’s time for Jay to try and update his palate.","Jay I was traumatised by seafood as a child, and my taste buds do not need ‘updating’ I reject the idea that Ines isn’t allowed to cook fish in our flat. She’s strong-minded and if she wants to cook seafood, she will. I think she’s just learned that, because I hate it so much, it’s simply easier if she waits until I’m away. What’s wrong with that? I compromise, she compromises. I’ll admit, I’m not over the moon when she cooks fish at home, but I just ask her to exercise caution if I’m there. The only times I have overreacted are when we had one non-stick frying pan to share between us, and I had to use it directly after her. Fish can leave a strong aftertaste and smell. For that reason, when we eat out at restaurants, I’d rather she didn’t stick her fishy fork in my food. I won’t stop her ordering a mound of molluscs, but I don’t want to taste them, thanks very much. Recently, Ines forgot to turn on the fan and turned our home into a marine smokehouse. There was a putrid stench for days I’ve been traumatised by seafood. At six, my dad gave me bad crabmeat and I was violently ill. I also used to work on a fish counter at Sainsbury’s and had to fillet mackerel. Fish guts got stuck to the bottom of my shoes. Once, I went on holiday and left my work shoes in my car and when I returned the stench was awful. Recently, Ines forgot to turn on the extractor fan when she was cooking, which turned our home into a marine smokehouse. There was a putrid stench in the flat for days, just like the one from my fish-gutting days. It brought all those horrible memories back. I told her that this couldn’t happen again. I’m a reasonable man, but boundaries had to be set after incidents like that. Now if fish is cooked, appropriate ventilation and extraction are required and I need prior warning. I need to sign off Ines’s fish-cooking plans, so I’m prepared. Ines is the primary cook in the house because she’s better at it than me. I’ll eat whatever she wants most of the time, but if she tells me prawns are on the menu then a little part of me dies inside. We’re never going to agree on that. My tastebuds don’t need “updating”, as she puts it. I’m quite happy never tasting fish again, and Ines shouldn’t try to force it down my neck if the mere smell triggers me.",guilty,medium
"We had a shortlist of baby names, but my wife has thrown one of them out for no good reason Our baby is due next February but we’ve already disagreed on lots of names. There were times when I said, “No, this name reminds me of this person I don’t like” or my wife, Naila, said the same. Naila knows the sex of the baby whereas I don’t, but we finally made a shortlist of both boys’ and girls’ names to keep things exciting. I was happy with it. We recently went for a scan and afterwards Naila changed her mind about one name. She said a friend told her this particular name reminded her of a famous musician who makes terrible music, and that the child might get bullied. A name is very important in Islam: it’s something that remains with a person beyond their life I got really defensive right there in the hospital. The name is associated with one of the greatest conquerors in Islam, our religion. I like it. It’s crazy to discount it for such a silly reason. But she didn’t budge and we both had to take some time to cool down. We had a silent walk home. A name is very important in Islam: it’s something that remains with a person beyond their life. We believe that on the day of judgment, God will call you to him, so you want to be proud to stand up and answer. Naila and I agreed that we don’t want a name that sounds lovely in Arabic but has a silly meaning in English. Until our disagreement I thought the shortlisted names we had agreed on together were perfect. Naila was wrong to throw it out of the window without discussion. Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights. We hadn’t argued about baby names before this but I know Naila is finding it difficult to choose. I think she’s feeling anxious about becoming a mum. Every name is a risk. Six months down the line there could be someone out there with the same name as our baby who commits the crime of the century. The important thing is that our child has their own identity and their own legacy. We both need to sit down and talk about it rather than discounting each other’s ideas. And Naila needs to stop giving other people power over her name choices.","I just want the best start in life for my kid, and I don’t want them to be bullied for their name We both want an Arabic name for our baby and added the name of a famous Islamic warrior to our list. But I soon remembered this was also the name of a really annoying guy I once went to school with. My friend also reminded me that it’s the name of a famous musician who I think makes really terrible music. After the scan that day I told my husband this name was off the list. Ameen is usually very laid-back and we had decided all the other names without any debate, but when I blacklisted this one, he got annoyed quickly and said that my reasons for striking off the name weren’t “big” enough. Every name that I loved before I became pregnant I can’t seem to stick with now He said: “Why do you care so much about the musician or what people think? It’s a beautiful name from a notable Islamic figure with a great history.” But of course I care. I want the best start in life for my kid: I don’t want them to get bullied. Things got heated between us and people started looking at us arguing in the hospital. I told him that I had a bad feeling about the name and that I didn’t want to compromise. In an Islamic partnership, your child’s name doesn’t have to be Arabic or from the Qur’an, but we wanted one. There’s an emphasis on giving your child a good name that they can live up to. And since we’re raising the child here, we want to ensure the English translation doesn’t mean something awful. Related: You be the judge: should my housemate return his out-of-control dog to the shelter? But every name that I loved before I became pregnant I can’t seem to stick with now. I’m finding it really hard to imagine my unborn child and my anxiety has been in overdrive, although finding out the sex of the baby has helped. If I change my mind about a name, that really should be it. I know what it’s like to be made fun of because of your name – I’ve seen it happen with my siblings. We need a name we both love. He will just have to set his heart on a different boy’s name, if indeed that is what we are having.",innocent,high
"Lakshmi spends her entire salary on the cats, then says she can’t afford to go on holiday with me I think of cats as pets, while my girlfriend, Lakshmi, refers to them as her “children”. We have Bella, Kiera and Fiona, who are a year old. Lakshmi and I usually live apart, but moved in together for the duration of lockdown. I had to move out of my home office, as it was turned into the cat’s bedroom. Lakshmi and I are very different in our attitudes towards the cats, but her stance affects us both. Lakshmi will spend her entire month’s wages on the cats. She has cancelled dinner dates, using the money to pay for cat food and vet bills. She recently spent £400 on a wifi-controlled catflap. When Fiona wasn’t eating normally, Lakshmi once spent £1,700 on scans, blood observations and checkups. It turned out Fiona was constipated. We had to cancel our holiday after that, as Lakshmi didn’t have enough money left to go. She spends loads on expensive cat food but gets annoyed if I don’t get the cheapest supermarket-brand food for us We’ve been together five years and keep our finances separate. Lakshmi will pay for a lot of the cat stuff, and I’ll take care of the human food. She spends loads on expensive cat food but gets annoyed if I don’t get the cheapest supermarket-brand food for us. I eat cheap ham, but the cats have the finest. She also gets mad if I point out that five daily dishes of dry cat food for three cats – as well as extra treats – is too much. I once said the cats were getting heavy and she didn’t talk to me for two days. We split the cost of our holidays and going out. Normally this works, but recently Lakshmi has complained about having no money. We want to have a long holiday to celebrate our five-year anniversary and I’m worried that she’ll cancel if some unexpected cat expense comes up. She once nearly missed a dentist appointment she’d waited a year for because Keira had a runny eye. Lakshmi should stop spending so much on the cats and prioritise her finances. It’s her choice how she spends her money, of course, but I’d like to know she can pay for her half of things if we are making plans together.","I feel that I have to prioritise my cats’ health, wellbeing and diet over my own Rob’s exaggerating about me spending all my money on the cats. But I can choose to live it up or to help my cats – and I choose the cats. You have to prioritise their health, wellbeing and food before your own. Rob complains about eating cheap food, but he’s usually happy to shop at Lidl so I don’t get why he cares. I buy the finest for the cats and the cheapest for us. There’s no way I’d give the cats low-cost supermarket food. They have lovely, glossy bodies because they eat the best. The time Fiona wasn’t right, Rob agreed with me. The vet confirmed she wasn’t well, so I was right The time Fiona wasn’t right, Rob agreed with me. The vet confirmed she wasn’t well, so I was right. Rob was just concerned about the money. I’m particular about the cats because I once missed Bella’s bad tooth. I had taken her for a checkup and the vet told me she had a rotten molar, and that she might have been in pain for eight months. I felt so guilty. Now, whatever I have to pay at the vets, I just pay it. Yes, you have the consultation fees, plus the medicine and an extra £100 if it’s out of hours, but I don’t mind. I save up. Once, Rob didn’t realise the cat had been bitten in the tail, and it got infected. Waiting can make things worse. Another time, Keira was blinking loads and Rob said: “Whatever it is, she’s not going to die from it.” It’s his favourite line. I wanted to take her to the vet out of hours, but Rob said to wait. The next day, it turned out Keira had a scratched cornea and needed eye drops. Again, I felt guilty as we could have gone earlier. Rob has less of a right to say anything about my cats – they are my responsibility. We live apart, but spend alternate weekends at each other’s houses. Rob is the cat’s “uncle”. He thinks it’s ridiculous that I spent money on electronic catflaps but why not? Rob and I are always going to disagree. I don’t earn as much as him, so I have to weigh things up. I do need to go to the dentist’s for a new crown, but Keira has watery eyes and Fiona might have dermatitis, so I’ve delayed it. I can live with a bad tooth but my girls can’t live with that.",guilty,medium
"Since our baby was born, Tom has not changed his routine, and is out most nights playing sport Tom and I have a nine-month-old baby called Isaac. Since Isaac was born, my life has changed drastically, but Tom’s has not. Most nights after work he either plays football or golf, or goes to a restaurant with his friends. If I get to see him every other night, it’s a good week. Recently Isaac vomited everywhere and I called Tom for help. He said: “I’ve got four holes left at golf. I’ll be back in an hour.” I had cleaned it all up by the time he got back. Tom teaches sports and prioritises it as part of his wellbeing. It is the one thing he doesn’t want to give up – but he’s quite self-centred for someone who’s meant to be a team player. I met him three years ago on Tinder and he moved in within three months. Then we got married and had a baby. I’m now back at work, as I don’t get much maternity leave. After the office I want to spend as much time with Isaac as possible: talking to him, reading him stories, preparing dinner, and making silly voices while I cook. Tom does take Isaac swimming, but sometimes when he’s in charge of the baby he just puts him in front of the TV, whereas I’m more interactive. Most nights after work Tom either plays football or golf The pandemic was tough as we don’t have any family around to help with childcare. Lockdown rules were quite relaxed where we live, so Tom kept to his routine while I stayed at home. I’d be in our apartment with Isaac while Tom was gone from 7am to 8pm, at work and playing sports. I also suffer from postpartum anxiety and ADHD. My life was really active before we had the baby. It was like being at university – parties and drinking all the time. Now my friends have changed: I have more of a mums’ network, because I need people who get what I’m going through. But I am a whole person and I miss being able to get my nails done and going to dinner when I want. I’m not saying Tom should give up all his hobbies, but if he would just be at home a bit more it would help. I tell him: it’s not babysitting, it’s parenting – Isaac is your baby too. I want Tom to work and play hard, then come home and enjoy spending time with our family.","I need my exercise for the endorphins. It’s natural for Jenny to do more as she is breastfeeding I’ll admit that Jenny only gets one or two nights a month to get her nails or hair done, whereas I get a few nights of leisure time every week. I’m a sports teacher, and I’ve always been active. I need to play football and tennis and go swimming once a week, and to the gym twice a week and play golf at the weekends. It seems like a lot but if I give up even one of my sports, I could become lazy. Once that happens, it impacts your work, relationship and family. Exercise releases endorphins that keep me going day to day. Jenny definitely takes the lead in parenting. We have a live-in nanny, who has taken the pressure off us both, but Jenny is hands-on and does a tremendous job. Isaac is nine months old and is exclusively breastfed, so it’s natural for Jenny to do more. I take Isaac swimming a lot, which I love. Jenny plays with Isaac more in the evenings, whereas I will play with him for a bit after work and then I’ll get tired. Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights. In our apartment Isaac has his little toys in a soft area, and when I mind him sometimes I put him there with the TV on in the background, which Jenny doesn’t like. But I’ll turn the volume down low, or just let Isaac watch two or three episodes of Bluey, as each one is only seven minutes long. We do have different parenting styles. Jenny wants to be close to Isaac all the time, whereas I am less hands-on because I want him to explore, learn things for himself and be independent. The time that Jenny phoned me about Isaac being sick, I was already out and it was quite a normal thing – babies vomit a lot. If it had been more serious, I would’ve dropped everything. Other times when he has been sick, we have handled it together. Jenny is a hands-on Mum and does a tremendous job When Jenny and I first met, we had time to go on date nights and travel. Getting married and having a baby has changed that. I think Jenny could try and relax a bit with Isaac, and both of us could make more time for each other. I will try and do my sports early in the morning or late in the evening when Isaac is sleeping so it doesn’t impact the time I spend with them, but I can’t give up my exercise routine.",guilty,high
"My boyfriend gets angry at my driving, saying it’s unsafe. I think he acts negatively towards all female drivers Isaac always has something to say when I’m driving, and it’s usually negative. He tells me that I’m driving too fast, or that I’m too close to the car in front. He’ll shout and say I’m going to cause an accident, when I know I’m fine. We met at school, and have been together for almost 13 years; we are now engaged. Two years ago at Christmas I was driving to his parents’ house down a windy country lane. When I approached a corner with pedestrians, Isaac said I didn’t brake quickly enough. He lost it and shouted: “You’re dangerous – you’re not even looking where you’re going.” He said I was unfocused and stupid in a really nasty tone. I pulled over and demanded he apologise or get out. When he refused, I got out of the car and stormed off. I was in a tiny gym top in the snow. It was freezing, but I couldn’t get back in the car until he’d calmed down. Eventually we went to his parents but the mood was frosty for hours. I think I’m the better driver but I don’t like being told what to do in the car I’ve never crashed or come close to having an accident, whereas Isaac had a near-miss once as a teenager – I think it’s made him paranoid. He passed his driving test the second time round – I passed mine on the first. I think I’m the better driver but I don’t like being told what to do in the car. He also complains about my choice of music (90s pop, the Spice Girls) and says it’s more distracting than his rock. When he’s driving I let him put on whatever. I think he acts especially negatively to female drivers. He’s said that my driving reminds him of his mother, and I’ve witnessed him get road rage with women. One time he called a woman a “ditzy idiot” out of the window when it was actually her right of way on a roundabout. I’m not sure he would do that to a man. Isaac needs to reconsider the way he talks to me (and others) when he’s in the car. He needs to learn to trust me like I trust him when he’s driving.","Nyala drives faster than I do, is always in a rush and is stubborn about advice – but I’m just trying to keep us safe We’re both control freaks in the car but I admit I’m particularly bad. I’m not aggressive or angry, but I tell Nyala off sometimes when she drives extremely close to the person in front of her. I was recently on the motorway when the driver in front of me made to turn off the road. Then they decided they didn’t want to make that turn and suddenly swerved back on to the road. If I had been close to that car I would have been in trouble. I tell her leaving gaps between cars is easy, but she tells me I’m overreacting, that she’s a better driver than me because she’s calmer. But driving’s not just about attitude; it’s about skill too. Nyala drives faster than me: she’s always in a rush. She’s stubborn when it comes to advice. That time at Christmas, she was driving too fast around a bend as we were late to my parents’ house because of her. She got offended when I told her she was driving irresponsibly but I didn’t apologise as she caused the situation. Nyala’s insistence on playing the Spice Girls every time she gets in the car is hard to take for a Bruce Springsteen fan As a teenager, I thought I was the the ultimate boy racer. But when I was 19, my car spun out of control on a country road and ended up in a ditch. I was shaken, but don’t remember discussing it with Nyala at the time. I was embarrassed. Now I’m slower, more careful. It’s rubbish that I am more critical of female drivers; I don’t trust anyone on the road. I’ve seen how careless people can be. Nyala’s habit of driving too close to the car in front reminds me of my mother, who once had a crash because of it. But I don’t think female drivers are worse than male ones. Nyala’s insistence on playing the Spice Girls every time she gets in the car is, admittedly, hard to take for a Bruce Springsteen fan like me. I do try to control the music, but that’s because rock is less distracting than the stuff you dance to. I could be gentler in my approach to Nyala’s driving, but in those moments, she stresses me out and there’s no time for tact. She needs to listen because I’m just trying to keep us safe. It pisses me off when she discounts my experience and says she’s a better driver: accidents can happen to anyone.",guilty,medium
"I love my housemate’s new dog but he isn’t training it properly and it’s disrupting my life. Should the dog move out? Joshua and I have lived together for six years, since meeting at university. We’ve always got along well; he’s laid-back, fun, and fairly tidy. When he adopted a dog from a shelter in the middle of the pandemic – a five-year-old greyhound called Biscuit – I was ecstatic. Biscuit is calm but a little nervous around new people, as he spent so long on a racing track. But Joshua hasn’t spent enough time training him, and the dog has developed habits that are disrupting my life. Initially, I wanted to move out when things got really bad, but now I don’t think it is me who should be further inconvenienced. Things are getting tense with Joshua. He’s too soft with Biscuit. The dog was weeing on the kitchen floor for the first few weeks, but slowly he got the hang of going outside. I encouraged Joshua to praise him whenever the dog did well, but feel that I’ve done more research on training greyhounds than he has. I told Joshua that something needed to change: implement a proper training programme, or put a shock collar on the dog Biscuit also has free rein of the sofa in the daytime, which is now covered in hairs. A dog needs its own bed. Joshua just says: “Well, that’s what rescue animals are like.” Biscuit also suffers from separation anxiety; he used to bark whenever Joshua left the room. He kept me awake howling for hours from the living room (which was originally Biscuit’s bedroom), and Joshua began sleeping on the floor next to him to calm him down. I told Joshua that something needed to change: implement a proper training programme, or put a shock collar on the dog. In the end, he just moved Biscuit into his bedroom – he now sleeps on the bed. This has stopped the barking, but made things worse because now Biscuit is needier than ever. Joshua won’t leave him alone for 10 minutes in case he starts barking. Joshua and I used to go to the pub with our mates, but now I barely see him, because he wants to be in to look after Biscuit. He should learn how to train Biscuit so he behaves better, or send him back to the shelter.","Abdul assured me that adopting a rescue dog wasn’t a big deal. Now, eight months later, he’s changed his mind Abdul agreed that I could adopt Biscuit, otherwise I wouldn’t have done it. We’ve known each other for years and if Abdul wasn’t comfortable with the idea of living with a dog, he should have voiced it earlier. Biscuit is anxious and needs time to acclimatise to a house, and I think we’ve made great progress. When Biscuit began barking a lot after moving in I did all I could to reassure him, but the obvious solution was to let him stay close to me, day and night. The barking went on for six weeks, then it stopped. Abdul was understanding at first, but he then suggested techniques like using a shock collar on Biscuit, which I think is inhumane. Abdul initially threatened to move out, but now he’s saying Biscuit should be sent back I appreciate that a rescue dog is a lot of work, and I’m grateful for Abdul’s help with house-training Biscuit, but the accidents really didn’t last that long. Any carpet that was damaged, I paid to clean. I’ve been happy to take on the main responsibilities. Related: You be the judge: I’m super tidy, my girlfriend is not. Should she change her ways? With the issue of Biscuit being on the sofa, I asked Abdul’s opinion before the dog moved in and he assured me that a dog sitting there wasn’t a big deal. Now, eight months later, he’s changed his mind and says Biscuit shouldn’t be allowed on the sofa at all. Of course, it’s going to be harder to reverse the habit now he’s got used to it. I don’t see the problem with Biscuit sleeping in my room at night and going to the couch in the day, when both of us are working. I clean the hairs off regularly and, luckily, greyhounds don’t really smell. Perhaps I was naive thinking everything could stay the same. I’m still in my 20s and having Biscuit is a lot of work. Abdul initially threatened to move out, but now he’s saying Biscuit should be sent back. We had a rocky first few months but there’s no way I’d return my dog to the animal shelter, I’ve made a commitment. Abdul just needs to decide whether he can ride it out a bit longer until Biscuit settles down.",innocent,medium
"My girlfriend is so messy, and I can’t bear her slapdash ways – lids left off and nothing put away I knew from the off we were quite different. Issues that seem small to Abby wind me up and cause me anxiety. I’m super tidy and for me everything has its place, while Abby is the opposite. She leaves the lids off toothpaste, food and drink, and it baffles me – I don’t understand why you wouldn’t put them straight back on as it keeps things fresh. We’ve been together for 18 months and moved in together two months ago. I feel I have to check up on what she is doing, and tidy up after her. She also leaves wet towels on beds after a shower, clothes in suitcases after returning from a trip, and doesn’t put things like the washing away immediately. Before meeting Abby I lived in my own apartment. I like being in control of my space and would consider myself a perfectionist. I’ve always liked coordinating my things: an even number of mugs and cups; Tupperware and foods categorised according to type (carbs, dairy, say); and everything facing the front so you can see the labels. Abby hoards crap, and constantly misplaces her stuff or mine. I can’t comprehend why someone would live like this I also ensure that my wardrobe is colour-coordinated with all the items hanging in order (jackets, trousers ) and that my desk drawers are sparse and neat. It means I don’t lose anything and I don’t have to live among clutter. Abby hoards crap, and constantly misplaces her stuff or mine; she has a drawer where she keeps all her makeup and it’s such a mess I have to stop myself looking in it or I get stressed. I can’t comprehend why someone would live like this. Before we moved in together, we did a test run whereby I lived at Abby’s for a month when I was between places. Then we lived in the same building but in different apartments for a few months – that was fun. But now we’re bickering over tidiness. I live my life in a very routined way. I know I am a bit extreme, but wouldn’t it be better if Abby adjusted her habits and became more like me rather than the other way around?","So things sometimes don’t go straight back in the drawer – it’s not the end of the world Leaving lids off things isn’t something I do consciously. Sometimes it backfires on me and I spill a drink or misplace the top belonging to something important but, really, I don’t lose much sleep over it. Dave can’t stand it because he’s incredibly tidy, but when I tell him that I don’t do it intentionally he asks me to try harder. Sometimes I feel a bit caged and controlled if I’m honest. Dave likes everything to go back exactly where it was as soon as we’re done using it. I admit that it makes life easier if things are always in the right place, but if I’m in a rush, the clothes will just have to stay where they are for a little while longer instead of going straight back in the drawer. It’s not the end of the world. Dave says I hoard things, but he is the opposite and I think that’s worse. He bins perfectly good clothes just to keep things in even numbers, and has thrown away glasses so the rest are symmetrical in our cupboards. One time he threw away a perfectly good spice jar because it was a different brand from the others. His shoes have to be in a single line organised by colour – black white, black white; instead of cleaning them he just throws them out when they get dirty and buys an identical pair. Dave bins perfectly good clothes just to keep things in even numbers In the bathroom there’s a storage box in a cupboard containing toiletries that I can’t access as it’s not easy to get to. But Dave keeps putting the box back there because he prefers how it looks in that part of the bathroom. I keep taking the box out and he keeps putting it back. It is frustrating as it’s becoming tit for tat. But the box needs to go where I can access it. Dave had two weeks of living by himself in our apartment before I moved in, so maybe it felt like me moving into his space, even though it’s ours. We had talked in advance about what living together would look like but there was a bit of a clash right away. I am messier than he is – I find it liberating not to feel too restricted by the small stuff. Dave needs order and routine to feel like he has control over his life. That’s not my vibe.",innocent,medium
"My lodger works out on our front porch, but it’s on a well-lit road and draws a lot of attention It started during the second lockdown, last autumn, when Fabio moved in to my four-bedroom flat. I’ve known him since we were 11, so when the lease ran out at his place, we agreed that he would move in with me. Fabio loves working out on the front porch of our house. His workouts last about an hour and consist of strength exercises with a kettlebell: swings, squats, lifts, presses. We live on a main road where there’s lots of traffic, people shopping and quite a few drug addicts around at night, so I think it looks rather strange. He has always been into fitness, whereas I only took up running for the first time recently. I’m quite self-conscious and care what people think, but Fabio is the opposite. He tells me he usually gets smiles or funny looks when he’s exercising. He thinks I’m jealous of his confidence but, really, I just don’t want to draw unwanted attention to our flat. When the gyms were closed, but the days were longer, Fabio would work out in our private garden at 5pm each day. But when winter came and it got dark earlier, he insisted on exercising on the front step, where there’s street lighting. I think he could have stayed in the garden and just done his exercising earlier in the day. Our neighbours come home and see this guy thrusting away right outside their dining-room window The flat below mine is on the same level as the porch, so our neighbours come home and see this guy thrusting away right outside their dining-room window. They are nice, but I can’t help feeling secondhand embarrassment whenever I watch Fabio. After spending the first lockdown living alone, I was very happy to have him around as he is chilled and level-headed. But sharing the flat with him has also taught me that we are more different than I thought – he is definitely much more of an exhibitionist than I am. We’re both still working from home and sometimes Fabio works out in the garden when he hasn’t had time to go to the gym. But I am dreading the darker nights, when he’ll move back to the front step. Can I ask him to stop exercising there?","I love swinging my kettlebells out there after dark: it’s a way to break up our time together Felix would never allow me to work out inside his house. It’s an old Victorian building and my workouts are quite vigorous – I’m swinging a 24kg kettlebell around in a high-intensity workout, so I could easily punch a hole through the wall. The natural answer is to exercise on the nice bit of concrete outside the house while I’m still working from home. Yes, it’s by the street, but who is bothered? Lockdowns have changed our relationship with going outside. We’ve been so restricted that exercising outside makes sense These lockdowns have changed our relationship with going outside. We’ve been so restricted that exercising outside our homes makes sense. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it. Perhaps I love the attention. When I moved in, I thought the world would be opening up and I’d be spending less time with Felix, but each evening it was just us. We became like an old married couple, arguing about what to watch on the telly. Exercise was a way to break up our life together. I missed dating and flirting – a cheeky bit of eye contact at the gym. I relished the occasional glance from a stranger in the street as it made my life a bit more interesting. I also got to keep fit – kettlebells are great for your legs and butt. I started off exercising in the back garden last summer, but by autumn it was darker much earlier so I couldn’t continue. There’s great light on the front step, so I will continue to exercise there on days I’m working from home or can’t be bothered to go to the gym. It saves commuting time and I’ve got used to it.

Available now in the UK and ROI. I know Felix disapproves. Sometimes I’d be doing a workout and he’d come back from a run and we’d chat outside the flat – he seemed fine with it then. But I’ve known him for 20 years and he hides his emotions very well. He hates confrontation. Now gyms are open, but I’m working from home until next year. There are days I won’t fancy going to the gym in winter, and so I’ll be back out at the front, swinging and squatting. What’s the problem?",innocent,high
"Is it ever OK to put eggshells back in the box? I find it disgusting to have them sitting in the cupboard I remember the first time Ben put eggshells back in the box, and the box back in the cupboard. I went a bit mad: “Why are you doing that? Put them straight in the bin!” On one occasion there was an egg box with six empty shells in it. I thought that was disgusting because those shells were sitting in the cupboard for ages, growing bacteria. I told him it was a bad idea to mix raw food with fresh food, and that it was lazy not to dispose of them right away. Ben’s reasoning for doing it was something like: “It would make more mess to carry the dripping shells over to the bin in my hands – and would slow me down because I would have to get all the way to the bin across the room.” I often find empty packets in the fridge, and he doesn’t put a lot of stuff straight in the bin, whereas I do But that annoyed me as it just didn’t make sense – the bin is close by as we have a really small kitchen. It makes sense to him as he’s a man of convenience, but it’s not something I’d ever do because I am naturally a lot tidier than he is. I guess my reaction is probably a bit more extreme because of my relationship with eggs. I hate eggs. I’ve got a phobia of them. I can’t stand eating them, looking at them or smelling them. If I’m with someone who is eating eggs I will tactically cover my eyes or look away so I don’t have to watch the eggs going into their mouth. It’s a bit difficult as Ben loves eggs and often has them for breakfast and will add them to other meals, too. We met five years ago and have been living together for three – and we’ve mostly adapted to each other, but Ben does have some funny habits in the kitchen, and his messy cooking still grates. He doesn’t tidy up as he goes – I often find empty packets of things in the fridge, for example, and he doesn’t put a lot of stuff straight in the bin, whereas I do. Because of the way he cooks, there’s always more for me to do when it’s my turn to wash up. But as far as I’m concerned, there’s no excuse for the empty shell habit.","Rather than carry them, dripping, to the bin, I put the shells back in the box: she thinks it’s lazy but it comes from a good place So, the eggshell thing: I only put the shells back in the box and back in the cupboard if I’m in a rush, or I’m feeling lazy. To me it makes perfect sense. You put the shells back in the box and let them accumulate until you have time to get to the bin. When I crack the eggs into the pan, I then have to get the shells across the kitchen into our bin in my hands. I don’t want to carry them as they might drip, and that will get me into a bit of trouble: I’ll have to clean up the mess, and that wastes time when I’m cooking. So I stick the shells back in the box and the box in the cupboard to deal with later. I don’t think it’s that unhygienic as we don’t have other raw foods in the cupboard. I do most of the cooking – it’s part of my method. I put the extractor fan on when I cook eggs so there are no smells, and wash everything up thoroughly When Cat saw I’d been putting shells back in the cupboard the first time, she wasn’t too impressed and we had a disagreement about it. She told me it was unhygienic and lazy, but my defence was that, honestly, it came from a good place – saving time in the long run and avoiding mess in the short term. She’s told me not to do it again but it’s happened a few times since, and she’s kicked off. I love eggs. I like to eat them in some form on most days – scrambled, poached, whatever. I will add an egg to absolutely anything and they have been my go-to breakfast during lockdowns. This article comes from Saturday, the new print magazine from the Guardian which combines the best features, culture, lifestyle and travel writing in one beautiful package. Available now in the UK and ROI. But when I’m cooking them, Cat won’t stay in the kitchen because they make her feel sick. I have to put the extractor fan on so there’s no lingering smell, and also wash everything up thoroughly. Maybe this is why she hates my eggshell habit so much. I am trying to stop but is it really that big a deal? I’m definitely not trying to wind her up – I’m just not that focused on cleaning up when I’m in the middle of cooking something good. And I won’t be giving up my eggs any time soon.",guilty,high
